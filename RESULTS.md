## v0.1.0-wip — 2026-09-10

> **Superseded (annotated 2026-09-11 09:20):** every number in this section was measured with a
> bug in the ported model math (`v41_ref.hc_post` mixed the Hyper-Connection residual with the
> transposed matrix). The engine ran, the numbers are what it did that day, but the model quality
> behind them was wrong (teacher-forced coding loss 2.16 nats instead of 1.37) and the DSpark
> acceptance was depressed (~2.4-3.0 instead of 3.0-3.75). See v0.2.0-wip below for the corrected
> state; NOTES.md ("2026-09-11 00:50") has the bug hunt.

**Measured 2026-09-10 on the box described below. Every number here was produced by a run on this
machine; nothing is extrapolated, scaled or quoted from elsewhere.** Where a planned measurement
was not taken it says so instead of guessing. The running log with the bug hunt behind these
numbers is NOTES.md ("Bring-up"); what still does not work is LIMITATIONS.md.

> **Status: work in progress.** Steps 1-5 of the bring-up (smoke, correctness, DSpark, engine/server
> API, serve) are complete and measured. Step 6 (the benchmark sweep) was stopped after
> the `code` row because the box was needed for interactive use, so **`prose`, the `angry-birds`/`mario`
> one-shots and the thinking-on run are not measured** and `results/oneshots/` is empty.

## Box and build

| | |
|---|---|
| machine | ASUS Ascent GX10, NVIDIA GB10 (sm_121a), 128 GB unified / 121 GiB visible, 20 cores, 1 NVMe (916 GB) |
| OS / driver | Ubuntu 24.04 (DGX OS base), driver 580.173.02, CUDA 13 |
| python | a venv with torch 2.13.0+cu130, triton 3.7.1, transformers 5.12.1 (docs/install.md) |
| model | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash`, full 48-shard checkpoint (510 GB) on local NVMe, FP4 routed experts read straight out of the shards |
| engine | this repo: `server/app.py --engine v41` -> `engine/v41_engine.py`, MoE on the Triton FP4 kernel `tools/fp4_moe.py` (`kernel: triton-fp4`) |
| other load | none — the box's other inference container was stopped for the whole of these runs, so the unified pool was ours alone |

The engine streams routed experts: only a resident hot set lives in the GPU arena and every miss is
an O_DIRECT read from the checkpoint. **A speed number from this recipe is meaningless without the
expert hit rate and the GB read that produced it**, so every table below carries them.

## 1. Load

Auto-sized arena, warm start ranked by `results/trace-full-20260910/stats/coverage.json`.

| stage | `max_seq` 8192 | `max_seq` 32768 (the served config) |
|---|---|---|
| non-expert weights (~19 GB) to GPU | 63 s | 63 s |
| DSpark experts (3 x 128 = 7.2 GB) resident | 5 s | 5 s |
| warm start | 3,891 experts / 73.2 GB in **16 s** (4.6 GB/s) | 3,526 experts / 66.3 GB in **14 s** (4.7 GB/s) |
| **total, process start to `ready` / `/health`** | ~85 s | **~90 s** |

Arena at `max_seq 32768`: **73.8 GB = 3,926 slots = 25.6 % of the 15,360 routed experts**
(3,526 LRU + 400 transient). Peak host use 99-101 GiB of 121; MemAvailable never below 19 GiB.

## 2. Correctness — teacher-forced NLL / top-1 vs the pure-torch reference port

`engine/v41_engine.py --teacher-forced corpus/trace_corpus.jsonl --act-quant`: 50 sequences,
each pushed through `Model.forward` in one chunk, next-token NLL and top-1 from the real head.
`--act-quant` matches the tracer's fp8 activation fake-quant (`results/trace-full-20260910/meta.json`);
serving runs with it off, which is strictly more precision.

Config: arena 80.7 GB / 4,291 slots (27.9 % resident), max_seq 8192, spec off, kernel triton-fp4,
act_quant on. 965 s of forward time.
Raw: `results/engine-tf-20260910/teacher_forced_engine_actquant.json`.

| corpus | tokens | reference (`tools/v41_ref.py`) NLL | **engine NLL** | delta | reference top-1 | **engine top-1** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| coding | 5,459 | 2.1527 | **2.1586** | **+0.0059** | 0.6384 | **0.6410** |
| general | 5,251 | 3.4124 | **3.4380** | **+0.0256** | 0.4738 | **0.4769** |

Both well inside the ±0.05 nats bar. The serving engine's math — expert arena, Triton FP4 grouped
MoE, engram rows read off NVMe, fixed-tile GEMMs — agrees with the pure-torch port end to end.

## 3. DSpark speculative decoding

`--spec-ab`: one load, `spec` toggled between runs, so all three runs share the arena and the LRU
state. Config: **arena 74.5 GB / 3,960 slots (25.8 % resident), max_seq 8192, kernel triton-fp4,
act_quant off, thinking off**, prompt 16 tokens, 64 output tokens.
Raw: `results/engine-tf-20260910/spec_ab2.json`.

| run | temperature | decode tok/s | steps | accept_len_mean | expert hit rate | NVMe GB | attn s | moe s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| greedy, spec **off** | 0 | 1.75 | 63 | — | 0.826 | 70.4 | 2.86 | 31.42 |
| greedy, spec **on** | 0 | **2.64** | 17 | **3.71** | 0.771 | 86.6 | 1.02 | 24.69 |
| sampled, spec **on** | 1.0 / top_p 0.95 | **2.64** | 20 | **3.40** | 0.794 | 92.0 | 1.21 | 25.55 |

**Greedy speculative output is token-for-token identical to greedy autoregressive output: 64 of 64,
first divergence `None`.** The verify loop is lossless as implemented. The sampled run is coherent.

DSpark is worth **1.5x** here: a 6-token verify block reads more expert bytes than a single token
does (86.6 vs 70.4 GB for the same 64 tokens) but amortises them over 3.7 accepted tokens.

## 4. Served throughput — `code` workload

Server: `./start.sh` with `.env` = `MAX_SEQ=32768`, `DEFAULT_THINKING=off`, `SPEC=1`,
`TRACE_STATS=results/trace-full-20260910/stats/coverage.json`, `ARENA_GB` auto -> **73.8 GB /
3,926 slots / 25.6 % resident, kernel triton-fp4, act_quant off**.
Bench: `bench/bench.py --workload code --runs 2 --osl 512 --ignore-eos`, thinking **off**,
temperature 0.6, top_p 0.95, 1 warm-up + 2 measured runs, **every run exactly 512 completion
tokens** (`finish_reason: length`). Raw: `results/bench-20260910/code.json`.

| run | TTFT | TPOT | decode tok/s | accept_len | expert hit rate | NVMe GB | engram rows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| warm-up | 12.48 s | 338 ms | 2.96 | 3.47 | 0.820 | 496.7 | 45,440 |
| run 1 | 10.98 s | 369 ms | 2.71 | 3.02 | 0.834 | 517.6 | 51,792 |
| run 2 | 11.12 s | 379 ms | 2.64 | 3.04 | 0.827 | 543.1 | 51,408 |
| **median of the 2 measured runs** | **11.05 s** | **374 ms** | **2.68** | **3.03** | **0.830** | **530.3** | **51,600** |

Where the time goes (run 1): prefill 62 tokens in 10.82 s — 2,473 prefill expert misses = 46 GB at
4.3 GB/s; decode 514 tokens in 188.3 s over 170 DSpark steps — 25,044 decode expert misses = 471 GB
at **2.5 GB/s effective**, `moe_s` 160.5 s, `attn_s` 9.1 s, `engram_s` 3.6 s.

**The headline of this recipe: 0.92 GB of expert weights are streamed from NVMe per generated
token** at a 25.6 % resident set. Attention, the engram lookups and the Triton MoE kernel together
are under 8 % of the decode time; everything else is the SSD.

### Not measured

| planned row | status |
|---|---|
| `prose`, `--runs 2 --osl 512 --ignore-eos` | **not measured** — not run in this tag (box needed for interactive use) |
| `angry-birds` one-shot, thinking off, 8192 max output | **not measured** — not run in this tag (box needed for interactive use) |
| `mario` one-shot, thinking off, 8192 max output | **not measured** — not run in this tag (box needed for interactive use) |
| `angry-birds` one-shot, thinking on, effort 75 | **not measured** — not run in this tag (box needed for interactive use) |
| `results/oneshots/*.html` | **empty** — no one-shot completed |
| long-context (`random --isl 8192`) | never attempted in this tag |

## 5. Performance work done during bring-up (A/B, same box, same work)

Two bugs outside the model math dominated the first runs. Both A/Bs are honest in the way that
matters here: greedy decoding at a fixed arena size reads the *same* expert bytes before and after,
so only the time changed.

| measurement | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| expert read, **1** in flight (the large-arena decode regime) | 8.11 ms/expert, 2.32 GB/s | **4.78 ms/expert, 3.93 GB/s** |
| expert read, 12 in flight | 4.02 ms/expert, 4.68 GB/s | 3.95 ms/expert, 4.76 GB/s |
| decode, 20 GB arena, 64 greedy tokens, no spec (152.05 GB read both times) | 0.93 tok/s | **1.21 tok/s** |
| decode, ~75 GB arena, 64 greedy tokens, no spec (~70 GB read both times) | 0.76 tok/s | **1.75 tok/s** |
| decode, ~75 GB arena, 64 greedy tokens, DSpark on | 1.74 tok/s | **2.64 tok/s** |

* **The LM head was converted bf16 -> fp32 on every token** — a 2.65 GB allocation per token
  (`head` is [129280, 5120]), plus 132 MB per drafted token for the Markov head. Next to a 74 GB
  arena that pushes the caching allocator into `cudaFree`/`cudaMalloc`. Both are stored fp32 once
  at load now (+1.33 GB and +66 MB resident), which is also what the reference does.
* **The expert reader issued six O_DIRECT reads per expert and synchronised the compute stream six
  times per miss.** An expert is now read as its **two** maximal contiguous file runs (a 1.1 MB
  scale run and a 17.7 MB weight run — the shards group all scales at the front and all weights
  behind them), verified byte-exact against `safetensors.safe_open`; and the pinned staging buffer
  goes straight into the arena with `non_blocking=True` on a **per-io-thread CUDA stream** that
  first waits on the compute stream.

## 6. Reference points (not our measurements)

For scale only — different hardware, all experts resident, no streaming: a public **4x** DGX Spark
TP4 vLLM build reports 39-77 tok/s single stream, TTFT 0.27-0.58 s, DSpark acceptance 3.56
(NOTES.md 0.5). That build needs four boxes and states "TP2 does not fit either way". This repo runs the same model, at FP4 expert quality, on **one** box, at 2.6-2.7 tok/s.

## v0.2.0-wip — 2026-09-11

Measured 2026-09-11 00:50-09:15 on the same box (Qwen container stopped, pool ours alone), same
checkpoint. Commits `bd24743` (hc_post fix) .. `22bd9a8`+ (FP8 dense, pruning, CB3). Python venv as
in v0.1.0-wip. Every row below is one run of the stated command; no benchmark sweeps were run
(this recipe records a single decode number per configuration).

### 2.1 The bug and what it changed (2026-09-11 00:50, commit bd24743)

`tools/v41_ref.py::hc_post` summed the 4x4 Hyper-Connection `comb` matrix over the wrong index
(comb @ residual instead of the reference's combᵀ @ residual). Found by proving decode == single-chunk
prefill bit-for-bit at every layer (so caches were innocent) and re-reading the reference line by line.

| teacher-forced, trace corpus (engine, one chunk per sequence) | before fix | after fix |
|---|---|---|
| coding NLL / top-1 (5,459 tokens) | 2.1599 / 63.9 % | **1.3708 / 74.4 %** |
| general NLL / top-1 (5,251 tokens) | 3.4263 / 47.1 % | **2.8635 / 55.1 %** |

Same code prompt, greedy: before the fix every path stuttered ("LRLR", "time-to-llive"); after it,
clean production-quality code. DSpark acceptance length on that prompt 2.4 -> 3.75.

### 2.2 Decode paths (2026-09-11 00:10-07:05)

`engine/fastdecode.py`: CUDA graphs per layer (attention+HC+router graph, host slot resolve, MoE+residual
graph), fused Sinkhorn Triton kernel, bf16 head, fixed-length masked indexer scoring.
`tools/fp8_linear.py`: dense projections read in their stored FP8 form (Triton, 223 GB/s of FP8 at
M=6, 1.9x the bf16 GEMM); the bf16 copies are gone, which grew the auto arena from 74 to 79 GB.

| verify step (6 tokens), everything resident | wall |
|---|---|
| reference path (`Model.forward`), 2026-09-10 23:5x | 436 ms |
| fast path, bf16 dense (00:10) | 183 ms + 16 ms draft |
| fast path, FP8 dense (07:00) | **173 ms + 15 ms draft** |

Greedy argmax agreement fast vs reference path: 100 % on the tested positions; hidden states differ
2-5 % from bf16 GEMM noise amplified by near-tie router flips (documented in fastdecode.py).

### 2.3 Speed ladder (greedy, temperature 0, same 40-token code prompt, 160-200 output tokens, DSpark on, fast path, FP8 dense)

| configuration (all 2026-09-11) | resident experts | decode tok/s | accept len | hit rate | NVMe GB / request |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| unpruned, streaming, arena 79 GB (07:01) | 27 % | 3.5 | 3.24 | 0.826 | 208 |
| keep 40 % (07:06) | 68 % of kept | 6.4 | 3.02 | 0.943 | 78 |
| keep 30 % (07:04) | 91 % of kept | 9.5 | 2.76 | 0.986 | 23 |
| **keep 31 %, arena 90.5 GB = 4,813 slots, transient ring 16 (08:12)** | **100 %** | **12.9** | 2.99 | 1.000 | 0.08 |
| keep 25 %, arena 79 GB (07:00) | 100 % | 13.6 | 3.09 | 0.999 | 7 |

Prefill (from the 2026-09-10 23:xx prefill work, still valid): 1,860-token prompt TTFT
118.5 s -> 33.7 s with 2048-token chunks + Decoder SWA Bounded Replay; short prompts 5-11 s.

### 2.4 Quality ladder of pruning (teacher-forced, held-out corpus `corpus/heldout_corpus.jsonl`: code and prose the trace never saw; 5,444 + 5,270 tokens)

Router restricted per layer to the top-N experts by trace frequency (mixed profile); loss in nats.

| kept / layer | coding NLL (Δ) | general NLL (Δ) | time |
|---|---|---|---|
| 384 (100 %) | 1.5067 | 3.1884 | 02:45 |
| 192 (50 %) | 1.5232 (+0.017) | 3.2528 (+0.064) | 02:45 |
| 154 (40 %) | 1.5285 (+0.022) | 3.3017 (+0.113) | 02:45 |
| 154 (40 %) + all kept experts at simulated 3-bit codebook | 1.5392 (+0.033) | 3.2122 (+0.024) | 07:50 |
| 120 (31 %) — the resident configuration above | 1.5729 (+0.066) | 3.3788 (+0.190) | 09:13 |
| 116 (30 %) | 1.5962 (+0.090) | 3.4241 (+0.236) | 02:45 |
| 116 (30 %) + coldest 40 % at simulated 3-bit | 1.5817 (+0.075) | 3.4187 (+0.230) | 08:38 |
| 96 (25 %) | 1.6687 (+0.162) | 3.5079 (+0.320) | 02:45 |

In-sample (trace corpus) deltas are in NOTES.md and are slightly smaller. The simulated 3-bit rows
use `engine/codebook_sim.py` (per-row 8-of-16 subset of the FP4 grid, 21 % relative weight error);
the packed format `tools/cb3.py` is bit-exact with it, its kernel `tools/cb3_moe.py` is correct but
not yet fast (54 GB/s vs 190 for FP4), so no CB3 speed row exists yet.

### 2.5 NVMe (2026-09-10 16:5x, O_DIRECT, 18.8 MB objects; unchanged)
1 in flight 4.1 GB/s · 8 in flight 5.4 GB/s · 32 in flight 5.6 GB/s.

### What is not measured in this tag
Thinking-on decode, long-context (>2k) serving, sampled (temperature 1.0) quality A/B, any bench
sweep, the CB3 format at speed, the container image end to end.

### 2.6 Addendum 2026-09-11 09:30-09:50 — decode step after the routing fix (same config as the keep-31 % row)

| change (commit) | verify step, everything resident | e2e decode tok/s (greedy, code prompt, 200 tokens) |
|---|---|---|
| baseline of 2.3 (22bd9a8) | 195 ms + 15 ms draft | 12.9-13.1 |
| torch routing for decode-sized calls instead of the per-arena-slot Triton router, bf16 gate GEMM, device slot LUT (9f172fb) | **168 ms + 15 ms draft** | **15.2-15.7** (acceptance 2.97-3.12) |
| Engram rows read in background threads, overlapped with the graphs (next commit) | unchanged | 15.4 (within run-to-run noise; the reads were 16 ms/step, now hidden) |

Profile of the 168 ms: expert kernels ~86 ms (at the 273 GB/s floor for 30 experts x 18.8 MB x 40
layers), FP8 dense ~29 ms (at floor), remaining bf16 GEMMs (wo_a, head, draft) ~20 ms, fp32 mixing
GEMMs ~8 ms, ~3,000 small elementwise/reduction kernels ~25 ms. Run-to-run spread of the e2e number
is ±5 % (greedy acceptance varies with bf16 nondeterminism: 2.97-3.12 on the same prompt).

### 2.7 Addendum 2026-09-11 09:50 — thinking on (served, keep 31 % resident, arena 90.5 GB, transient 8, LUT)

One request through the gateway, `chat_template_kwargs.thinking=true`, `reasoning_effort=high`,
temperature 0, 400 tokens (all reasoning): **TTFT 3.9 s, decode 21.4 tok/s, DSpark acceptance 4.11**,
hit rate 1.0. Same prompt with thinking off (2.6 addendum): 15.2-15.7 tok/s at acceptance ~3.

### 2.8 Addendum 2026-09-11 10:20 — long prompt through the served resident config (keep 31 %, arena 90.5 GB, transient 8, LUT)

One request through the gateway with an 8,192-token prompt (the server's context clamp), greedy,
thinking off, 200 output tokens: **TTFT 39.6 s (207 prompt tok/s), decode 16.9 tok/s, acceptance
3.28**, output a coherent summary of the prompt. The 8k prefill runs through the chunked encoder +
decoder-replay path (2048-token chunks); decode at an 8k KV is not slower than at 100 tokens
because the CSA2 index keeps the attended set at 512 tokens.

### 2.9 Addendum 2026-09-11 10:55 — FP8 grouped `wo_a` kernel and fused decode attention (same served config)

Step A/B on `engine/profile_fast.py` (keep 31 %, arena 90.5 GB): **165.7 → 152.7 ms** verify step,
draft 14.3 → 13.7 ms. Two hundred greedy tokens, same prompt and flags as 2.6: **16.86 tok/s**
(acceptance 3.06) with the new kernels vs 15.28 (acceptance 2.97) with `DSV41_WOA_FP8=0
DSV41_FUSED_ATTN=0` back to back. The `wo_a` projection now runs from its stored FP8 (7.95 ms/step,
was 13.89 as a bf16 einsum) and attention scores/softmax/PV run in one Triton kernel with bf16
keys and fp32 math (1.0 ms/step, was 3.1 fp32 SIMT). Unit tests in `engine/test_kernels.py`;
details and caveats in NOTES.md (2026-09-11 10:25-10:55).

### 2.10 Addendum 2026-09-11 11:20 — split-K fp32 kernel for the HC mixing projections, no `kv_all` copy

The two Hyper-Connection mixing GEMMs per layer (M=6, N=24, K=20480, fp32) ran on a cuBLAS kernel
at 29 GB/s (84 µs each); a split-K Triton kernel (`tools/fp32_skinny.py`, fp32 math, 4e-7 relative
to cuBLAS, both at the fp32 floor against an fp64 check) runs them at 108 GB/s (22.7 µs). The
compressor projections (N=512) stay on cuBLAS, which is faster there. The attention kernel now
reads the window ring and the CSA2 rows through two base pointers instead of a concatenated copy
(bit-identical output). Verify step on `engine/profile_fast.py`: **152.7 → 147.2 ms**, draft
13.7 → 13.0 ms; GPU time per step −9.1 ms.

The single 200-token greedy decode line moved the other way: 16.71 tok/s (acceptance 2.83, 71
steps) vs 17.11 (acceptance 3.06, 65 steps) with `DSV41_HC_KERNEL=0`. The 4e-7 change in the
mixing values flips borderline routing decisions, the greedy text diverges after a few tokens (both
outputs are coherent), and this prompt landed on a lower-acceptance trajectory; one sample cannot
separate that from run-to-run acceptance spread (±5 %, see 2.6). Every prompt-independent number
(step time, GPU time, the un-graphed comparison in `engine/test_fastdecode.py`) improved, so the
kernel stays on by default. Details in NOTES.md (2026-09-11 11:00-11:20).

### 2.11 Addendum 2026-09-11 12:10 — CB3 (3-bit) expert kernel at speed; graph merging measured as no gain

**CB3 kernel (`tools/cb3_moe.py` v3, unit test `tools/test_cb3_moe.py`):** one real expert at decode
shapes, expert bytes per second:

| kernel | ms | GB/s of expert bytes |
|---|---|---|
| FP4 (18.80 MB/expert) | 2.14 | 184.1 |
| CB3 v1 (the parked gather variant) | 17.41 | 19.9 |
| CB3 v2 (new plane layout, Triton byte ops) | 1.97 | 154.0 |
| **CB3 v3 (512-weight blocks, inline PTX decode)** | **1.67** | **181.5** (best run 182.0) |

A 3-bit expert now costs 0.787× the time of an FP4 one; dequant is bit-identical to
`engine/codebook_sim.py`, kernel output within 8.6e-5 of the FP4 kernel on the same re-quantized
weights. The decisive factor was tile width, not instruction count: on this box a row-strided read
runs at 101 GB/s for 16-32 B tiles and 185-218 GB/s from 64 B up, so the format's blocks were
widened to 512 weights (w2's K=2304 is packed as 4×512 + 256). Arena arithmetic at 90.5 GB: 4,813
experts all-FP4 (31.3 %), 6,260 all-CB3 (40.8 %). Keep 40 % at simulated 3-bit was measured in 2.4
at coding 1.539 / general 3.212 nats held-out, better than the served keep-31 % FP4 on both. The
kernel is not yet wired into the serving path (a second arena tier); that is the next step.

**Graph merging:** 41 graph replays per step → 3 (at the Engram boundaries) and pinned staging for
the Engram rows: step 147.2 → 146.6 ms, decode 16.56 vs 16.63 tok/s (bit-identical output). GPU
busy time is 144.9 of the 146.6 ms; the rest is per-kernel latency inside the graphs (about 5,300
kernels per step), not launch count. Segmentation stays on (`DSV41_GRAPH_SEGMENTS=0` restores);
pinned staging is off by default (`DSV41_ENGRAM_PINNED=1`).


## v0.3.0-wip — 2026-09-11

Measured 2026-09-11 10:00-14:10 on the same box and checkpoint, the pool ours alone. Commits
`94a96a6` .. this tag. Every row is one run of the stated command; no benchmark sweeps were run.
The kernel work that led here is in the dated addenda 2.8-2.11 above; this section is the shipped
configuration that changed.

### 3.1 Shipped default: keep 40 %, every resident expert in the 3-bit CB3 format

`PRUNE_KEEP=0.40 EXPERT_FORMAT=cb3 ARENA_GB=90.5 TRANSIENT_SLOTS=8 KEEP_FREE_GB=10`, everything
resident, CUDA-graph decode path, device slot LUT. Same prompt and flags as 2.6 for the decode
line; teacher-forced on `corpus/heldout_corpus.jsonl`; TTFT on the 1,806-token prompt of 2.x.

| | keep 31 %, FP4 (v0.2.0-wip default) | **keep 40 %, CB3 (this tag)** |
|---|---|---|
| resident experts | 4,800 = 90.2 GB (31.3 %) | **6,160 = 89.0 GB (40.8 %)** |
| warm start (packing on the GPU) | 19 s | 183 s |
| decode, 200 greedy tokens | 16.61 tok/s (acceptance 2.83, 71 steps) | **18.98 tok/s** (acceptance 3.03, 66 steps) |
| TTFT, 1,806-token prompt | 11.11 s | **9.81 s** |
| held-out coding NLL | 1.5705 | **1.5384** (−0.032) |
| held-out general NLL | 3.3790 | **3.2087** (−0.170) |

The CB3 row reproduces the simulated 3-bit keep-40 % row of 2.4 (1.5392 / 3.2122) to 0.0008 /
0.0035 nats: the packed format, the kernel and the simulation are the same arithmetic. Against the
full unpruned model on the same corpus (2.4: 1.5067 / 3.1884) this configuration costs +0.032
(code) / +0.020 (prose) nats.

Prefill does not run the CB3 decode kernel: above 64 token-expert pairs the experts are unpacked
to FP4 codes on the fly (bit-exact) and the FP4 kernel runs; on one layer at 2,048 tokens that is
1.35x the MoE time of an FP4 arena of the same size. The two-tier arena (hot experts back at FP4,
cold in CB3) is not built; at 40.8 % all-CB3 there is no headroom in 90.5 GB for it.

### What is not measured in this tag
Thinking-on decode in this configuration, sampled quality A/B, long-context (8k+) serving in this
configuration, the container image end to end.

### 3.2 Addendum 2026-09-11 16:00 — attention projections in FP4 (served config, `DSV41_DENSE_FP4=attn`)

Dense bytes per verify step (from the safetensors headers): attention projections 3,734 MB,
shared experts 1,417 MB, `wo_a` 1,344 MB, other 436 MB. A dense FP4 kernel (`tools/fp4_linear.py`,
E2M1 codes + one UE8M0 scale per 32 weights along K, quantized at load from the stored FP8; unit
test `tools/test_fp4_linear.py`) reads 0.53x the bytes and wins on the wide matrices (`wq_b`,
`wo_b`: 199 GB/s of FP4 vs 221 of FP8) but not on the narrow ones. Held-out teacher-forced, one run
per setting, against the keep-40 % CB3 baseline 1.5384 / 3.2087:

| group in FP4 | coding | general | decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| shared experts | 1.5531 (+0.015) | 3.2740 (+0.065) | kept in FP8 |
| attention projections | **1.5403 (+0.002)** | **3.1738 (−0.035)** | **default from this addendum** |
| both | 1.5527 (+0.014) | 3.2323 (+0.024) | kept in FP8 |

The −0.035 on general is within what a 53-sequence corpus can resolve, not a gain. Decode line
back to back: 19.11 tok/s (acceptance 3.03) → **20.85 tok/s** (acceptance 3.23); prefill 4.12 →
3.28 s on the same prompt; verify step on `engine/profile_fast.py` 134.4 → 125.6 ms; 1.75 GiB of
resident weights freed. The shared experts are the one dense FFN every token passes through and
the FP4 weight error (12 % relative) shows there; `wo_a` stays FP8 through the grouped kernel.

### 3.3 Addendum 2026-09-11 17:40 — `wo_a` in FP4 and a leaner decode loop

The output projection's first factor (`attn.wo_a`, 1,343 MB read per verify step) now runs through a
grouped FP4 kernel (`tools/fp4_linear.py::fp4_grouped_linear`, one group per third grid axis),
quantized at load from the stored FP8. Held-out teacher-forced against the 3.1 baseline
(1.5384 / 3.2087): **coding 1.5346 (−0.004), general 3.1498 (−0.059)** — inside what this corpus can
resolve, and on the good side of zero. Resident weights 8.34 → 7.70 GiB. Kernel time in the step
7.95 → 4.56 ms; at T=6 in isolation the FP4 grouped kernel is 150-158 GB/s against the FP8 one's
207-215, and reads 0.53x the bytes, so 1.31-1.44x in wall time.

`DSV41_LEAN_STEP=1` (default; `=0` restores the previous code) computes the greedy accept/reject on
the GPU and reads back one 7-element pinned tensor instead of up to eleven separate syncs, builds
the verify block into a preallocated buffer, and drops redundant clones and a duplicate buffer
preparation. Sampling semantics are unchanged: at temperature 0 both paths produce byte-identical
text, and the temperature path is the original code.

| | verify step (`engine/profile_fast.py`) | wall per step, 200-token run |
|---|---|---|
| 3.2 configuration (`attn`) | 125.6 ms | 156.5 ms |
| this addendum (`attn,wo_a`, lean step) | **118.9 ms** | **149.1 ms** |

The decode line on the standard prompt moved 20.62 → 20.02 tok/s because the DSpark acceptance on
that one prompt fell from 3.23 to 2.99; at equal acceptance the new configuration is 21.7 tok/s.
Per-step time is the number this addendum claims. Prefill on the same prompt 3.27 → 2.61 s.

Instrumenting the loop (`DSV41_STEP_TIMING=1`) also corrected an earlier reading: the gap between
the graph harness and a fresh 200-token run is not removable Python. It is one un-graphed drafter
call on the first step, the Engram host-to-device copy absorbing queued graph work by design, and a
cold Engram row cache — a second decode in the same process costs ~140 ms/step and a third ~133 ms,
tracking the Engram read time and nothing else.

### 3.4 Addendum 2026-09-11 19:00 — the LM head in FP8, and a 2-bit expert tier that was not built

**The head.** `head.weight` is [129280, 5120] bf16 = 1.324 GB and is read in full twice per decode
step (the verify step and the DSpark draft); in 3.3's profile it is 5.79 ms of cutlass at 232 GB/s.
`DSV41_HEAD_FMT` = `bf16` (default) | `fp8` | `fp4` stores it in the dense projections' format
(e4m3 + one UE8M0 scale per 32x32 block, 0.663 GB, `tools/fp8_linear.py::quantize_to_fp8`) or the
routed experts' (E2M1 + one scale per 32 K weights of a row, 0.352 GB), quantized on the GPU at
load; above decode-sized M a quantized head dequantizes 16,384 vocabulary rows at a time into
cuBLAS. Held-out teacher-forced against the 3.3 baseline (1.5346 / 3.1498), one run each:

| head | coding | general | weight rel err | head GEMM at M=6 | decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| bf16 | 1.5346 | 3.1498 | — | 5.68 ms, 233 GB/s | — |
| **fp8** | **1.5351 (+0.0004)** | **3.1512 (+0.0014)** | 0.027 | **2.96 ms, 224 GB/s** | **default from this addendum** |
| fp4 | 1.5502 (+0.0156) | 3.1572 (+0.0074) | 0.118 | 2.38 ms, 148 GB/s | rejected on coding |

With the fp8 head the 200-token greedy output is byte-identical to the bf16 one at matched positions
(the second decode of each process; in every arm, bf16 included, a process's first decode differs
from its own second at token 9, because the first step drafts eagerly before any graph exists).
`engine/test_fastdecode.py` argmax agreement 1.00 / 1.00 on both parities, step 116.5 / 117.8 →
113.2 / 113.9 ms and draft 14.3 / 13.5 → 11.6 / 10.6. Decode line: 143.0 → 137.2 ms per step,
21.62 → 22.88 tok/s. In one process with the head swapped under a fixed arena, the verify step is
118.9 → 114.6 ms and the draft 13.4 → 10.7, with the two CB3 expert kernels unchanged — the
separate-process form of that A/B measures the arena's page placement instead and reports the
opposite sign (NOTES 2026-09-11).

**The 2-bit tier: measured, not built.** A CB3 slot filled with a four-entry row codebook repeated
to its eight entries carries exactly a 2-bit format's arithmetic at unchanged size, so the quality
question was answered inside the shipped configuration (`--sim-cb2-frac`). Held-out teacher-forced,
keep 0.40, against the same 1.5346 / 3.1498:

| coldest fraction of the kept set at 2 bits | coding | general |
|---|---|---|
| none (shipped) | 1.5346 | 3.1498 |
| 0.30 (1,840 of 6,160 experts) | 1.5471 (+0.0125) | 3.1966 (**+0.0468**) |
| 0.50 (3,080 of 6,160 experts) | 1.5563 (+0.0217) | 3.1940 (**+0.0442**) |

The whole prose penalty is paid by the coldest 30 % and does not grow after it, at 1.6x the budget a
tier would have to fit in. The packed CB2 format and its kernel were built and measured anyway
(`tools/cb3_moe.py::CB2ArenaV2`, 9.99 MB per expert = 0.691x CB3, bit-exact against the FP4 kernel
on the same weights): 143.8 GB/s of its own bytes against CB3's 168.7 in the same run, i.e. 0.81x in
wall time for the cold experts, which carry 22 % of the routed pairs at a 0.50 cold fraction — about
3 ms of a 119 ms step even before the loss is counted. `EXPERT_FORMAT` keeps its two values; nothing
in the serving path changed.


### 3.5 Addendum 2026-09-11 19:30 — thinking-on decode, the router's top-k, and the verify block size

**Thinking on, in this configuration.** One request each through the gateway, temperature 0, 400
output tokens, the same algorithmic prompt (2.7's number came from the much slower 09:50 engine and
a different prompt):

| | thinking off | thinking on (`reasoning_effort=high`) |
|---|---|---|
| TTFT | 1.67 s | 2.19 s |
| decode | **25.86 tok/s** | **21.44 tok/s** |
| DSpark acceptance | 3.51 | 2.90 |
| wall per step | 135.7 ms | 135.2 ms |

The step costs the same to 0.4 %; the whole difference is acceptance, so a single prompt's tok/s is
a property of the prompt as much as of the engine.

**How many experts a step activates.** `DSV41_ROUTE_STATS=1` (`engine/diag_topk.py`) counts the
DISTINCT routed experts a verify block asks for per layer — the quantity that sets the bytes, since
an expert is read once however many of the block's six tokens route to it. Measured on the real
decode path, keep 0.40 pruned: **20.96 per layer at the checkpoint's top-6**, not the ~30 that 36
routed pairs would suggest, i.e. **12.12 GB of expert reads per step** at 186 GB/s over the two CB3
kernels' 65.0 ms.

**Reducing the router's top-k** (`DSV41_TOPK`, default the checkpoint's 6; the gate weights are
renormalized over the survivors by the line that already normalizes the six; the DSpark drafter's
own top-3 of 128 is untouched). Held-out teacher-forced, one run each, the k=6 row re-measured here:

| `DSV41_TOPK` | distinct experts/layer | expert bytes/step | coding | general | decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 20.96 | 12.12 GB | 1.5351 | 3.1512 | **shipped** |
| 5 | 17.58 (0.839x) | 10.17 GB | 1.5396 (+0.0045) | 3.1762 (**+0.0250**) | rejected on prose |
| 4 | 15.30 (0.730x) | 8.85 GB | 1.5890 (+0.0539) | 3.2330 (+0.0818) | rejected on both |

k=5 would have been worth 8.3 ms of a 114.9 ms verify step (106.6 ms; expert kernels 65.02 → 57.44,
less than proportional because 17.6 experts per layer gives the kernel fewer concurrent programs and
it gives back 5 % of its per-byte rate) and 23.45 → 24.87 tok/s on the standard 200-token prompt.
`engine/test_fastdecode.py` at k=5 is argmax agreement 1.00/1.00 on both parities, so the switch is
the same computation graphed and un-graphed. It fails the +0.015-nat gate on prose by 1.7x and is
not shipped. Prose leans on the tail of the router's distribution and code does not — the same split
the 2-bit expert tier showed in 3.4.

**The verify block size** (`DSV41_BLOCK`, drafted positions, odd, default the checkpoint's 5; the
verify width must stay even for the ratio-2 compressor's parity). One run per setting:

| verify block | step + draft | acceptance | **ms per accepted token** | 200 greedy tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 110.7 ms | 2.70 | 41.0 | 23.72 tok/s |
| **6 (shipped)** | 124.8 ms | 3.14 | **39.7** | 23.45 tok/s |
| 8 | 137.0 ms | 3.45 | **39.7** | 23.00 tok/s |

The step grows nearly linearly in the block and acceptance sublinearly, exactly as expected; their
ratio is flat between 6 and 8 (a tie within this box's ±5 % acceptance spread) and worse at 4. Block
8 also drafts beyond the horizon the DSpark head was trained for and lengthens the per-burst
latency, so the block stays at 6. Nothing in the serving configuration changed in this addendum.

### 3.6 Addendum 2026-09-11 23:40 — the 3-bit expert format degenerates in free generation, and is withdrawn

Asked for a single-file HTML game, the configuration shipped in 3.1 (keep 40 %, every resident
expert in the 3-bit CB3 format) writes one token over and over until the output cap:

```
```html
<!<!DOCTYPE><!DOCTYPE><!DOCTYPE><!DOCTYPE> ...
```

Everything else was eliminated one variable at a time, same prompt, greedy, 200-300 tokens each
(`results/htmlbug/`): the graphed decode path, CUDA graphs entirely, the fused attention kernel,
speculative decoding (off: identical loop), the FP4 dense projections and the fp8 head (both
reverted: identical loop), and sampling (temperature 0.0 / 0.3 / 0.6 / 0.8: identical loop, so the
distribution itself is degenerate, not the choice rule). The last variable left was the expert
configuration, and it is decisive:

| experts | output |
|---|---|
| CB3 3-bit, keep 40 % (3.1) | the loop, distinct-token ratio 0.03 |
| FP4, keep 31 % (v0.2.0-wip) | `<!DOCTYPE html / <html> / </html>`, closes and stops, ratio 0.71 |

**The shipped default returns to FP4 experts at keep 31 %** (box `.env`: `PRUNE_KEEP=0.31
EXPERT_FORMAT=fp4`), keeping the changes that are independently gated: the fp32 router (3.7 below),
the FP4 attention and `wo_a` projections, and the fp8 head. A 600-token Python class on that
configuration comes back complete and well-formed at 30.1 tok/s (acceptance 4.72).

**What this says about the gate.** 3.1 measured *better* than the configuration that works —
held-out teacher-forced 1.5384 / 3.2087 against 1.5705 / 3.3790 — and 2.4 predicted it from the
simulator to three decimal places. Teacher-forced loss scores the next token of text the model is
shown; it never lets an error compound, so it cannot see a model that cannot stay on its own
trajectory. Every quantization decision in this repo was taken on that number alone. A format that
improves it can still be unusable, and nothing here measured free-running generation until a user
asked for an HTML file.

`EXPERT_FORMAT=cb3` and its kernel remain in the tree, measured and documented, and must not be a
default again without a generation gate (`engine/test_spec_lossless.py` plus a long-generation
check) in front of it.

### 3.7 Addendum 2026-09-11 21:25 — the graphed decode path routed tokens to the wrong experts

`Model.moe` computes the router gate as `mm(y.float(), gate_w)`; the graphed path computed it in
bf16, added 2026-09-11 morning as a micro-optimization. The gate picks 6 of 384 experts and its
scores are dense with near-ties, so bf16 changed which experts ran: at layer 0, where the inputs are
bit-identical, 11 % of the picks differed, rising to 31 % in the middle layers, and each layer then
ran a different FFN than the reference.

| layer | activation error before / after | routed experts equal before / after |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.0000 / 0.0000 | 0.89 / **1.00** |
| 6 | 0.1070 / **0.0073** | 0.83 / **1.00** |
| 12 | 0.1361 / **0.0087** | 0.69 / **1.00** |
| 36 | 0.0803 / **0.0131** | 0.69 / 0.94 |

Logit error against the reference 0.049 → 0.012, argmax agreement 1.00 on both parities. The fused
attention kernel (`DSV41_FUSED_ATTN`, default 0 since this addendum) is a second, smaller source of
the same divergence: with it on, deep-layer error returns to 0.048-0.093 and routed experts equal
falls to 0.72.


## v0.4.0-wip — 2026-09-12

Measured 2026-09-12 03:00-05:40 on the same box and checkpoint. Every row is one request through the
server; the quality column is the generation gate described in 4.1, not a loss number.

### 4.1 The gate this tag is built on

Teacher-forced loss cannot see a model that has stopped being able to stay on its own trajectory: it
scores the next token of text the model is shown and never lets an error compound. The configuration
shipped in v0.3.0-wip measured **better** on it (1.5384 / 3.2087 against 1.5705 / 3.3790) and wrote
`<!DOCTYPE><!DOCTYPE><!DOCTYPE>` for as long as it was allowed. Every configuration in this tag is
gated on free generation instead: five prompts (a story and an essay at temperature 0.7, a Python
module, a single-file HTML game, a JavaScript module at temperature 0), **900 to 2,000 tokens each**,
and the output must keep a distinct-token ratio above 0.25, repeat no line more than 30 % of the
time, and — where the generation finished on its own — be structurally intact.

Both thresholds were learned the hard way. A 300-token gate passed configurations that collapse at
900. Repetition ratios alone pass output whose CSS has decayed into `inset - 00 1 pix - 00 1 pix`,
so the gate checks balanced tags, closed fences and unit spelling too.

### 4.2 The keep-set is a cache policy, and it must be sampled from every workload

`corpus/trace_corpus.jsonl`, which ranked the experts for every earlier tag, is 50 documents whose
only content marker is Python: no HTML, no JavaScript, no CSS, no SQL, no configuration files. The
experts that write markup never fired while the trace was taken, ranked cold, and were dropped by
every pruned configuration. That single fact explains the degeneration chased through v0.3.0-wip.

| keep-set (all at keep 44 %, CB3, otherwise identical) | story | Python | HTML |
|---|---|---|---|
| original corpus | 0.27 | 0.51 | **0.03** |
| + a 12-gram repeat ban | 0.32 | 0.51 | **0.07** |
| `trace_corpus_v2` (web, code, config, technical prose) | 0.43 | 0.50 | 0.40 |
| `trace_corpus_v3` (narrative fiction and dialogue) | 0.54 | 0.58 | **0.04** |
| **union of both traces** | **0.56** | **0.47** | **0.59** |

(distinct-token ratio; <= 0.15 is degenerate.) A corpus of web and code fixes markup and leaves long
prose repeating; a corpus of fiction fixes prose and loses markup. At 44 % of the experts the two
rankings compete for the same slots, and the answer is to rank on both: an expert trace is a
per-token histogram, so `results/trace-union` is the concatenation of the two traces' per-layer
arrays (190 sequences, 36,250 tokens) with the statistics rebuilt from it. No third trace run.

### 4.3 Shipped configuration

`PRUNE_KEEP=0.44 EXPERT_FORMAT=cb3 ARENA_GB=98 TRANSIENT_SLOTS=8 KEEP_FREE_GB=6`,
`TRACE_STATS=results/trace-union/stats/coverage.json`, `DSV41_DENSE_FP4=attn,wo_a`,
`DSV41_HEAD_FMT=fp8`, `DSV41_FUSED_ATTN=0`, penalties 0. 6,779 experts resident = 44.1 % of all
routed experts, expert hit rate 1.0, no NVMe traffic during decode.

| workload | tok/s | DSpark acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| single-file HTML game | 36.6 | 5.07 |
| SQL schema and query | 31.8 | 4.69 |
| JavaScript module | 28.2 | 4.12 |
| German technical writing | 25.2 | 3.68 |
| arithmetic with working | 25.1 | 3.56 |
| Python module | 24.3 | 3.56 |
| thinking on, effort high | 18.6 | 2.66 |
| explanation (temperature 0.7) | 18.1 | 2.64 |
| long story (temperature 0.7) | 17.1 | 2.46 |

Prefill on a 5,014-token prompt: **14.9 s = 337 tok/s** (the all-resident arena reads nothing from
the SSD; the same prompt through the streaming configuration is 87 tok/s). A tool call returns
`finish_reason: tool_calls` with well-formed arguments. The generated HTML game passes every
structural check — doctype, balanced `<style>` and `<script>`, a 3x3 grid, a win check, a reset
button, click handlers, no corrupted CSS units — and stops on its own at 982 tokens.

The step is ~145 ms in every case; the spread is entirely how well the DSpark drafter predicts each
kind of text, about 5 accepted tokens per step on markup against 2.5 on prose.

### 4.4 What this tag fixes in the engine

* The graphed decode path computed the router gate in bf16 while `Model.moe` computes it in fp32.
  The gate picks 6 of 384 experts and its scores are dense with near-ties, so 11 % of the picks
  differed at layer 0 — where the inputs are bit-identical — and up to 31 % deeper in. Every layer
  after that ran a different FFN than the reference. Now fp32: routed experts agree 1.00 at layer 0,
  logit error against the reference 0.049 -> 0.012.
* `DSV41_FUSED_ATTN` defaults to 0: the fused decode-attention kernel returns deep-layer agreement
  to 0.072-0.093 and routed agreement to 0.72.
* A keep-set can now be built from `coverage.json` alone (the per-category histograms are written
  into it), so a checkout reproduces one without the per-layer trace arrays.

### What is not measured in this tag
Sampled quality A/B at scale, long-context (8k+) generation quality, the container image end to end,
and the tool grammar of `server/tool_grammar.py` on real weights (it is off by default).

### Router-score placement smoke (2026-10-05)

Added opt-in `DSV41_PRUNE_METRIC=score`: observed placement uses raw positive
router scores for the original top-k selections, with separately normalized
request score history. The existing frequency trace remains the cold-start prior.
Native FP4 weights and numerical settings stayed unchanged; this is not EXL3.

The two-Spark live profile uses keep 0.61 (235 experts/layer), a 90.1 GB arena,
16 transient slots, 524288 context, speculation and the existing attention overlay.
Both ranks agreed on 119 guarded fields. After five calibration prompts disjoint
from evaluation, the same five fixed MMLU-Pro questions used in the preceding
full-streaming smoke scored **4/5**, all valid, in **11.39 seconds total**
(median 1.58 seconds). Answers A/G/A/B/D exactly matched that full-streaming
run, which scored 4/5 in 52.38 seconds. Earlier frequency runs scored 3/5 and 4/5.

On these five score-mode requests, aggregate selection misses were **17.44%**;
score-weighted misses were **15.68%**. Historical frequency selection misses on
the same questions were 23.14% and 22.21%, but their history, compiler warmup
accounting, and cache state differed. This is a diagnostic smoke, not an isolated
metric A/B, broad accuracy estimate, or sustained-throughput measurement. No
large benchmark was run. Forty-seven selected tests passed in the serving image,
including fused GPU recorder parity, graph replay, history units, and swap checks.

Raw results, manifests, source hashes, launch settings and rollback settings:
`../llm_benchmark/results/custom-router-score-20261005/`.

### 2026-10-05: fixed-history expert ranking and bounded contribution rescue

Small MMLU-Pro diagnostic: 14 new questions (seed 20261006, one per category),
greedy direct answers, all swaps frozen, 9,400 resident experts at 61% kept.
Each launch started from the same saved request-unit history, prior 4. Frequency,
raw router score, score plus confidence depth, and score plus calibrated prefill
rescue all answered 9/14, with identical letters and no invalid requests.
Frequency and score differed by 257 placements; selection misses were 13.36% and
13.99%, respectively. This gives no evidence that the lower missing rate or raw
score ranking improves answers. It is a small diagnostic, not an accuracy estimate.

The rescue profile used two disjoint public texts (132 tokens) and layers 0–3
only. Nine layer/expert rescue events caused five actual expert reads across the
14 questions, without correcting an answer. Median question time rose from
0.897 to 0.973 s. Keep the prototype disabled. Details and limitations are in
[critical-prefill.md](docs/critical-prefill.md).

Two timed repetitions after one warmup, 128 output tokens each, unique prefixes
(no prefix reuse): confidence depth improved code from 45.50 to 52.325 decode
tok/s (+15.0%), with identical outputs; prose went 20.19 to 19.71 (-2.4%), also
with identical outputs. End-to-end median times were code 3.193/2.835 s and
prose 6.671/6.828 s. This is an opt-in code speed result, not a general default
win; confidence remains off in production.

Offline global layer allocation retained 95.765% versus uniform 95.678% of the
blended calibration mass at the same budget. It was not run live after the goal
was clarified as preserving critical experts rather than maximizing routing mass.

### Full-routing control and layer allocation (2026-10-06)

On the identical 14-question manifest above, unrestricted routing (keep 1,
384 transient slots, same native FP4 weights and numerical settings) scored
**11/14**, versus **9/14** for frozen score/uniform placement. The only changed
answers were math 7867 (A -> J) and philosophy 11054 (I -> B), both recoveries.
The math answer independently matches the analytic derivative, -153.5947587.
Every request was valid and had zero prefix reuse. Full-routing request time
totaled 101.87 s versus 35.20 s for uniform, including first-request warmup;
medians were 6.121 versus 0.897 s. This control isolates two pruning-sensitive
answers without changing the model format; it is not a broad quality estimate.

An explicit fixed layer budget then kept 330 experts in layers 0–4 and 35–39,
204 in layers 5–14, and 203 in layers 15–34: the same 9,400 total slots, no
streaming, same ranking/history, all swaps frozen. It recovered math but lost
biology 2868 (E -> F), leaving **9/14**. Philosophy remained wrong. The other
category changed I -> A and remained wrong. This rejects this particular edge
allocation as a quality improvement; it does not establish a general layer
importance ranking. The allocation option is experimental and unset by default.

Isolating the late budget (330 experts in layers 35–39, 222 in 0–14, 221 in
15–34; again 9,400 total) scored **10/14**: math recovered, biology stayed correct,
and all other letters matched uniform. All requests were valid with zero NVMe
expert reads. This is a placement-only recovery on the diagnostic set; a separate
validation set is needed before treating it as a general policy improvement.

### Immediate layer streaming qualification and group probes

`DSV41_STREAM_LAYERS` now supports prefill and decode, loading current router
picks before MoE through the transient ring. The keep set stays at 9,400 experts;
160 transient slots fit in the same arena without evictions of residents. Both
ranks guard the selected layers and graph-split policy at boot. Fifty focused
tests passed, including current-token load ordering and transient-only decode.

All-layer streaming matched unrestricted routing on biology 2868, math 7867,
and philosophy 11054: E/J/B, all correct. Separately streaming 0–4, 18–22, or
35–39 produced E/A/I in every arm, matching the pruned baseline. None of these
five-layer groups alone explains the recoveries. The late-only retention result
above is consequently not proof of late-layer causal dominance.

A short 39-token generation with layers 35–39 streamed correctly counted 1–20
in nine completed verification steps, 2.53 s total, 1.64 GB expert reads and
34.96 decode tok/s. This qualifies that mixed graph path on a short prompt;
it is one functional check, not a sustained-throughput comparison. See
[layer-stream.md](docs/layer-stream.md) for constraints. Answer probes and the
multi-token check are saved under `../llm_benchmark/results/expert-tuning-20261005/`.

The follow-up block-necessity sweep used only the two previously identified
pruning-sensitive cases. It fully routed all layers except one five-layer block,
which kept the original frozen 235-expert mask. These are post-hoc diagnostic
cases, not a held-out accuracy estimate. All 16 requests were valid, with identical
question prefixes and no prefix reuse. Each arm began from the same demand seed.

| Pruned block; all others fully routed | Math 7867 | Philosophy 11054 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0–4 | A, wrong | B, correct |
| 5–9 | J, correct | I, wrong |
| 10–14 | J, correct | B, correct |
| 15–19 | J, correct | B, correct |
| 20–24 | J, correct | B, correct |
| 25–29 | J, correct | B, correct |
| 30–34 | J, correct | B, correct |
| 35–39 | J, correct | B, correct |

Thus early blocks are necessary under this particular full-routing control;
restoring 0–4 alone was insufficient. Lack of damage from individually pruning
later blocks does not prove they can all be pruned together, or that later layers
are generally unimportant. Protocol: `results/expert-tuning-20261005/layer-ablation-protocol.json`;
raw responses and summary: `../llm_benchmark/results/expert-tuning-20261005/layer-ablation-summary.json`.

Streaming 0–9 with all other layers pruned at the original budget recovered
philosophy but not math. On the full 14-question diagnostic it scored **10/14**;
every other letter matched the 9/14 baseline. This demonstrates that the two
early block-necessity results cannot simply be combined into a sufficient policy
for both examples. It is a targeted diagnostic gain, not an independent accuracy
estimate. Artifact: `stream-first10-quality.json` in the benchmark results directory.

Fine-grained diagnostics used persistent per-layer mask tensors and an
authoritative per-request broadcast, avoiding ten full model reloads. Each of
layers 0–4 was separately pruned on math, and 5–9 on philosophy, in the otherwise
fully routed model. **No individual layer broke its tested answer**. Pruning
0–2 or 3–4 separately also preserved math; pruning 5–7 broke philosophy, while
pruning 8–9 preserved it. These are joint effects, not proof of a single dominant
layer or expert. Restoring the first **20** layers recovered both answers and
preserved the biology control. Full-routing controls matched before and after.

Fifty-one focused tests passed for the revised mask-control path, including
root-authoritative masks with no peer file, in-place address preservation, and
errors broadcast to both ranks. The first harness pass stopped on a transient
busy state after its three correct reference answers; partial results were kept,
and the harness now waits for idle before changing masks. Complete measurements:
`single-layer-ablation-retry.json`; the partial pass is `single-layer-ablation.json`.

Reducing the sufficient 20-layer policy to **0–9 plus 15–19** (15 streamed layers)
preserved all three probe answers. Streaming **0–14** (also 15 layers) still lost
math. Thus the middle block 15–19 matters under partial routing, despite its
individual block ablation causing no damage under full routing. Layer importance
depends on the other routing decisions, not just position. These two arms and an
unchanged full-routing control are in `fifteen-layer-sufficiency.json`.

Further preset subsets all preserved E/J/B on the three probes: 0–7 plus 15–19
(13 layers), 0–2 plus 5–7 plus 15–19 (11), and **3–7 plus 15–19 (10)**.
All had an unchanged full-routing control afterward. The ten-layer subset was
then frozen for normal serving-path qualification and a separate 14-question
validation seed 20261007. It is the smallest passing policy among these tested
subsets, not a globally minimal or generally optimal layer set.

### Ten-layer policy: matched validation and cost

The fixed **3–7 plus 15–19** policy was then tested through the normal mixed
serving path, with diagnostic mask changes disabled. All arms used native FP4,
the same initial score-history seed, 235 residents per layer (9,400 total), the
same 90.1 GB arena, 160 transient slots, and all swaps/prefix reuse disabled.

| Manifest | Frozen resident routing | Ten layers fully routed | All layers fully routed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Diagnostic seed 20261006, 14 questions | 9/14 | 11/14 | 11/14 (earlier keep-1 control) |
| Separate seed 20261007, 14 questions | 9/14 | 9/14 | 12/14 (all-layer streaming control) |

The matched resident diagnostic reproduced every original baseline letter.
Ten-layer streaming recovered math 7867 and philosophy 11054, and changed law
1789 from G to A while still wrong. All other diagnostic letters matched the
baseline. On the separate manifest, **every ten-layer answer letter matched
the resident baseline**. Full routing recovered business 834 (G -> I),
engineering 12071 (A -> J), and history 5003 (F -> C), with no other changes.
Thus the ten-layer policy misses pruning-sensitive cases outside its selection
set. It is not a demonstrated general quality improvement and remains off.

A short identical-output decode check counted 1–20 (39 output tokens), using
unique prompt identifiers, one warmup and two measured repetitions per arm.
Resident / ten-layer medians were **1.219 / 2.184 s** per request and
**45.35 / 39.58 decode tok/s**. Ten-layer median reported expert reads were
0.95 GB versus zero for resident routing. No resident promotions occurred.
This is a functional qualification and an exploratory cost comparison on a short
fixed answer, not a sustained throughput estimate. On the separate 14-question
manifest, median request times were 0.733 / 1.553 s for resident / ten-layer.

The ten-layer policy was frozen before the separate manifest's responses;
subsequent block analysis of its three full-routing recoveries is post-hoc.
Raw responses, health configs and comparison: `candidate-10-quality.json`,
`candidate-10-validation.json`, `validation-uniform-quality.json`,
`validation-uniform-diagnostic.json`, `validation-full-stream-quality.json`,
and `layer-policy-summary.json` under the benchmark results directory.
The policy freeze and source hashes are in `results/expert-tuning-20261005/`.

### New-case block sensitivity: early, middle, and later layers

After validation, the three newly identified pruning-sensitive cases were used
for a separate **post-hoc** block sweep. Graph topology stayed fixed with all
layers split; only the authoritative routing masks changed. All 39 short requests
were valid, no prefixes were reused, and expert generation stayed zero. Full
routing controls before and after gave the same correct I/J/C answers.

Combining the two earlier diagnostic cases with these three new cases gives this
limited sensitivity map. Each row prunes only that block; all other layers retain
full routing. A blank finding means no answer loss on these five cases, not proof
that the block is unimportant in general.

| Pruned block | Correct reference answers lost |
| --- | --- |
| 0–4 | Math 7867 |
| 5–9 | Philosophy 11054; history 5003 |
| 10–14 | Engineering 12071 |
| 15–19 | Engineering 12071 |
| 20–24 | None on these cases |
| 25–29 | None on these cases |
| 30–34 | Business 834 |
| 35–39 | None on these cases |

Three broad sufficiency policies were specified before this sweep's responses:

| Full-routing layers; other layers pruned | Business 834 | Engineering 12071 | History 5003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0–19 | G, wrong | J, correct | C, correct |
| 20–39 | I, correct | A, wrong | F, wrong |
| 0–9 plus 30–39 | I, correct | A, wrong | C, correct |

This provides direct counterexamples to a universal early/late preference:
engineering depends on middle blocks, business on a later block, and history on
an early block. Engineering also needs more than restoring 15–19 in the
ten-layer policy, showing necessity and sufficiency differ. These findings guide
future expert-level protection; they do not justify streaming whole regions by
default or selecting a new policy on the same validation cases and calling it
held out. Protocol: `results/expert-tuning-20261005/fresh-block-ablation-protocol.json`;
responses and condensed table: `fresh-block-ablation.json` and
`fresh-block-ablation-summary.json` in the benchmark results directory.

Final state: the normal `deepseek` EP2 pair is restored on the latest local code
image, with streaming, diagnostic mask control, explicit layer allocations,
calibrated rescue and confidence depth disabled. The original 0.61 keep ratio,
16 transient slots, 90.1 GB arena, production score database, prefix cache and
adaptive swap settings are restored. Both running ranks and the workspace match
on all six modified runtime modules; hashes are in `runtime-source-verified.json`.
The final health/config check passed on both ranks, and a floor request returned
A. Fifty-one focused tests passed; `git diff --check` passed. TensorFold remains
stopped. No model downloads or conversions were performed for these trials.
Final checks are saved in `results/expert-tuning-20261005/final-production-*`.

## 2026-10-06: author's topic database and maxmin selection (TP2)

Ported the author's fixed topic-selection path at upstream commit
`45a0caffc8f080f8fd32d22f4e3d4e9122e25e5f`: 39 topics, frequency and saliency
histograms for every 40 x 384 layer/expert position, plus the greedy maxmin
ranker. The 13,048,828-byte statistics file is pinned by SHA256
`eb5214a78791a1e8cc0db51353f6ea7931f4f2d18142776f90784e01e67f16d3`.
Only statistics were obtained; no model weights were downloaded or converted.
The tiny image overlays use the already-built runtime on both nodes.

Saliency is the trace's accumulated gate-weight times expert-output norm.
Maxmin normalizes each topic separately and repeatedly admits the best unused
expert for the least-covered topic. Its priorities are selection order, not
router-score mass. The port requires fixed placement: no history blending,
prefill/end/decode/urgent swaps, or unequal layer allocation. Default counts/sum
with no explicit topics retains the existing adaptive coding/general trace path.
The existing unconditional score broadcast remains authoritative; no collective
was added. The TP2 configuration guard now includes source, ranker, topics,
statistics SHA256 and actual initial expert-ID SHA256, rather than only mask size.
Profile coverage is reported as a trace proxy, not answer accuracy.

Exact CPU parity with the pinned upstream maxmin function passed for **both
families across all 39 topics, 40 layers, 384 experts**. Sixty focused tests
passed, including nine profile tests. Both image copies have matching engine
and profile modules and identical statistics checksums. Setup and parity records
are in `results/expert-profile-20261006/`.

### Fixed comparison and separate validation

All arms use current output-sharded TP2, native FP4, 0.61 keep, **235 residents
per layer / 9,400 total**, a **90.1 GB arena**, 16 transient slots and the same
existing numerical settings/weight overlay. Streaming, calibrated rescue,
explicit layer budgets, confidence scheduling, prefix reuse, prefill graphs and
all swaps are disabled. No inference kernels changed for the profile port.

The baseline reconstructs the normal two-topic trace plus an immutable snapshot
of the current request-unit score database, with prior 4 and mean observed
history weight **75.16%**. A CPU reconstruction verifies the exact baseline
expert-ID fingerprint. New profiles use all 39 topics and no observed-history
blend. Thus baseline-to-topic comparison changes both prior and selection
policy; frequency-to-saliency comparison isolates histogram family at the same
maxmin policy and topic list. They replace 3,085 / 3,036 of the baseline's
resident IDs; frequency and saliency differ by 1,277 IDs.

The frozen protocol uses MMLU-Pro direct-letter, nonthinking, greedy, max 16
output tokens, one question per category. Seeds 20261008 and 20261009 and their
manifests were recorded before responses. The first-set winner alone receives
separate validation; a candidate must beat baseline there before promotion.
No topic subset, keep budget or ranking parameter was tuned on these answers.

| Expert selection | First set, 14 questions | Separate set, 14 questions | First-set raw miss rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current trace + router-score history, frozen | 8/14 | 12/14 | 13.89% |
| 39-topic frequency + maxmin, fixed | 10/14 | 9/14, including one format failure | 27.19% |
| 39-topic saliency + maxmin, fixed | 8/14 | Not selected for validation | 27.84% |

Frequency recovered business 857 (G -> I) and law 1621 (I -> G) in the first
set with no newly wrong correct answers. Chemistry 4225 changed between wrong
answers. Saliency recovered business but lost biology 3425 (C -> D); chemistry
and psychology changed between wrong answers. Its net score tied baseline.

On the separate set, frequency lost engineering 11975 (E -> B) and health
6764 (B -> D). Chemistry 3555 started explaining the Joule-Thomson coefficient
instead of returning a letter and reached the unchanged 16-token limit.
The original harness stopped there; its partial result is retained, and an
explicit continuation ran only the remaining 11 questions. **No response was
retried or given extra tokens.** All 14 observations are combined in
`counts-validation-complete.json`; the invalid response is a failure in the
all-14 denominator, not silently excluded as in valid-only accuracy.
Physics changed between wrong answers. No baseline error was recovered.

This is a small comparison, not an aggregate model-quality estimate. It rejects
these fixed all-topic profiles as a serving default under the predeclared rule.
The first-set result also demonstrates that raw miss rate alone cannot rank
quality: frequency had almost twice the misses but two more correct answers.
All quality requests reported zero expert NVMe reads and expert generation zero.

### Short generation and timing checks

Both topic profiles generated run-length encoding Python that parsed and passed
seven cases, including empty and Unicode strings. Frequency gave exact 1–20
counting outputs on all three short requests and converted `nihongomo ikeru?`
to `日本語もいける？`. Saliency passed two exact counting checks; one echoed
`run_1:` before otherwise correct numbers. It wrote `日本語も行ける？`, which
fails the selected exact kana-form check but is a lexical variation, not an
encoding error. Both outputs were valid UTF-8. These checks catch practical
format/code failures; they do not establish broad quality.

The same LRU-code and coastal-climate prompts were also timed at 128 output
tokens, with one warmup and two measured repetitions per arm, prefix reuse off.

| Workload | Baseline median request / decode rate | Frequency/maxmin median request / decode rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LRU Python code, 128 output tokens | 3.234 s / 44.85 tok/s | 3.996 s / 39.62 tok/s |
| Coastal climate prose, 128 output tokens | 6.895 s / 19.44 tok/s | 5.894 s / 22.87 tok/s |

Outputs differ between policies and are truncated by the token cap, so this is
an exploratory throughput comparison, not a passing code-quality test or a
universal speedup. The functional Python qualification above uses a complete,
separate task. Saliency did not qualify for this additional timing comparison.

Protocol, manifests, original/continued raw responses, statistics provenance,
selection IDs, qualification code and condensed comparison are under
`results/expert-profile-20261006/`. See `protocol.json`, `summary.json`,
`selection-comparison.json`, `upstream-parity.json`, `*-qualification.json` and
the `*-discovery.json` / `*-validation*.json` measurements. The production
demand file and original environment stayed unchanged throughout the trials.
The optional profile implementation remains available; the new image is used
with the original adaptive selection settings.

Final production health passed for `deepseek` on TP2. All original numerical,
budget, adaptive swap and prefix settings match the pretrial service; only the
image changes to include the optional profile code. The exact initial expert
IDs reproduce the frozen baseline, and both running ranks match the workspace
on seven runtime modules. No experimental profile, streaming, mask control,
layer allocation, calibrated rescue or confidence policy is enabled.
Normal-service counting, Japanese conversion and Python checks passed, including
seven functional code cases. One preliminary functional check stopped while
post-request adaptive work was still busy; the retained retry waits for idle and
is not included in the frozen timing comparison. Production history resumes
its normal updates after restoration. TensorFold remains stopped.
Final evidence: `runtime-source-verified.json`, `production-runtime-env.json`,
`production-restored-health.json`, `production-qualification-retry.json` and
`production-final-health.json`. `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-10-06: lower priority for Mia's 2-bit layers

Parsed the already-present EXL3 quantization metadata, SHA256
`2949806ec66ff269a539caebe8afc55ba7d7c7220e011edc478fa67812a95ae1`.
Every routed w1/w2/w3 matrix in layers **18–22** uses 2 bits (1,152 matrices per
layer); the other 35 backbone layers use 3 bits. This is quantization tolerance
evidence, not a measurement of expert-omission damage.

One fixed **0.8 layer-priority factor** was chosen before responses. Normalizing
to the same 9,400 residents yields **193 per layer in 18–22, 241 elsewhere**,
instead of uniform 235. It removes 210 slots from those five layers and spreads
six additional slots to each other layer. Lowering a layer's scalar scores with
an unchanged uniform quota would not change its selected experts, so the test
uses the existing explicit layer budgets and their TP2 boot guard. No runtime
engine code, weights, numerical kernels or format changed for this test.

Both arms use native FP4 TP2, 90.1 GB arena, 16 transient slots, the same trace,
sum prior, router-score ranking and immutable current-history seed
`beef789badad39c7c29b2eb5b1576ad1ea4ef9cb1d2e189345cc2012d06858e9`.
Every swap/rescue/streaming trigger, prefix cache and prefill graph is disabled.
Expert generation stays zero. History is copied to isolated arm databases, and
the production environment and history file remain untouched during testing.

The protocol predefines fresh MMLU-Pro seed **20261010**, one question in each
of 14 categories, plus the five previously identified pruning-sensitive cases:
math 7867, philosophy 11054, business 834, engineering 12071, history 5003.
All requests are nonthinking, greedy, direct-letter, max 16 output tokens.
The candidate must improve fresh accuracy with valid responses, avoid regression
on the known-case total, and pass short functional checks to be promoted.
No discount or topic was retuned after responses.

| Allocation | Fresh questions | Prior sensitive probes | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Uniform 235 per layer | 8/14 | 2/5 | 10/19 |
| Mia-informed 193 / 241 | 7/14 | 3/5 | 10/19 |

All 38 responses were valid. The candidate lost law 1501 (E -> H) on the fresh
set, recovered history 5003 (F -> C) on the probes, and changed engineering
12071 between wrong answers (A -> G). Every other answer matched. The new
current-history baseline already answers math and business correctly; older
history's baseline results are therefore not appropriate controls here.

The policy fails the predeclared fresh-set criterion and stays disabled. This
is a measured tradeoff for one discount, not evidence that all bit-informed
priorities fail. Compression keeps each selected expert's contribution while
changing its weights; pruning changes which expert contributes. The latter
needs its own quality measurement. No full streaming, TensorFold launch,
model downloads, conversion or new service was used.

Metadata, fixed quotas, manifest, seed hash, raw arm responses, source provenance
and answer changes: `results/mia-layer-priority-20261006/protocol.json`,
`layer-counts.txt`, `*-fresh.json`, `*-known*.json`, and `summary.json`.

During this test, a separate user-message extraction helper was added and tested
without changing serving or expert ranking. It selects the last actual user
message from the original API input before the model encoder merges tool results
or treats mid-conversation system messages as user-like. Nontext attachments,
tool results and other messages are excluded. It preserves original messages
and exact text spacing/Unicode. Six focused tests passed. Unmarked documents
inside the same plain-text field require a client boundary. The current router
recorder still counts the full request; token-scope/priority integration is a
separate change. See `server/latest_user.py` and `docs/gotchas.md`.

Final health passed on the original `deepseek` TP2 configuration: uniform layer
budget restored, all experimental policies off, original adaptive swaps and
prefix settings on. Its exact initial expert IDs match this trial's frozen
baseline. The production environment and saved history still match the pretrial
copies. Both containers are running; TensorFold remains stopped. Final record:
`results/mia-layer-priority-20261006/production-final-health.json`.
`git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-10-06 — latest-user discovery, protected admission and 5% layer discount

Implemented `DSV41_USER_PROMPT_STREAM`: verified tokenizer ranges locate only
the last original user's explicit text before tool merging. During a streaming
discovery prefill, those rows receive full expert routing. Their normalized
gate-score mass orders admissions within the fixed layer quotas. Admitted used
experts are protected from prefill, decode and idle adaptive eviction until the
next request replaces the protection. Older messages, system/developer input,
tool results and structured attachments are excluded from this temporary score;
the conversation is still available for attention. Text-only and concurrency 1
are currently required. Plain-text documents inside that same user text cannot
be separated without a client boundary.

Mia's 2-bit layers 18–22 receive relative layer weight 0.95, others 1.0.
Largest-remainder rounding preserves 9,400 residents: 225 in those five layers,
237 in layers 0–14 and 236 elsewhere. This moves 50 slots compared with uniform
235/layer. The 90.1 GB arena remains fixed; 160 transient slots accommodate all
cold experts in the smallest layer while retaining all residents. Native FP4
checkpoint weights were unchanged. No model downloads or TensorFold launch.

The first prototype loaded/promoted after first-answer logits were computed.
It scored 10/14, losing engineering and math while recovering business. That
timing is too late for a direct-letter answer. Version 2 therefore rebuilds the
prompt once using the new resident set after admission, with streaming and
demand collection paused. Both the encoder state and the first answer now use
the chosen residents. The normal 128-token bounded decoder replay stays on;
upper-layer discovery rows are the user-text intersection with that window.
Protection/plan broadcast is unconditional on both ranks, including empty
selections; the feature and version are in the TP2 boot guard.

| Policy | Correct / 14 | Valid / 14 | Mean question wall time |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Frozen uniform control | 11 | 14 | 1.530 s |
| Frozen 5% discount only | 11 | 14 | 1.551 s |
| Prompt admission v1, rejected first-token timing | 10 | 14 | 8.944 s |
| Prompt admission v2 + 5% discount | 12 | 14 | 8.659 s |

All arms started from immutable history SHA256
`beef789badad39c7c29b2eb5b1576ad1ea4ef9cb1d2e189345cc2012d06858e9`, with
other adaptive swaps and prefix/response caching disabled. Questions were fixed
before answers (seed 20261011; manifest
`3e60f71315a4d09288a50a36cab1ae986942951aae2cc3af0aa7feaf2b777443`).
Admission arms retain their promoted masks across this ordered small suite,
as the real policy does. Version 2 reused the same questions to assess the
timing repair; this is exploratory, not an independent holdout or broad quality
claim. The discount alone changed no answers. Final admission recovered
business q671 (H→D) and psychology q2367 (F→I), but lost engineering q11754
(I→A). Law q1581 remained wrong. No response was retried or discarded.

Three short counting requests per arm (one warmup, two measured) averaged
1.465 s total baseline vs 2.886 s final policy, with prefill 0.408→1.869 s and
decode 0.985→0.952 s. Outputs matched the 1–20 instruction. Japanese conversion
passed and the generated Python RLE function passed seven cases, including
Unicode and empty input. With no user selection/admission, full resident prompt
rebuilds at 6 and 426 tokens reproduced the original logits exactly. The final
question arm promoted 689–1,490 experts per request, protected 4,814–6,645,
and reported at most 74 layer/expert overflow entries. All decode expert cache
miss counters were zero: decode stays resident, rather than streaming.

62 focused unit/integration checks and 17 mock-server end-to-end checks passed.
The initial benchmark mistakenly required all 40 layers to process all user
tokens despite bounded replay. Its assertion and first completed response were
kept; the corrected check verifies exact window intersections and the suite
resumed without repeating that question. Version 1 responses remain saved.

The user-requested policy and 5% discount are retained as an explicit pilot,
with the original production demand DB and adaptive settings restored. Required
prefix/disk/response caches and prefill graphs stay off; transient slots are
160. The policy offers a small measured net gain and substantially higher prompt
latency. It does not establish that prompt router mass reliably predicts all
later answer experts. Detailed protocol, raw responses, functional checks,
source provenance, timings, rejected version and pilot settings are in
`results/user-prompt-priority-20261006/`.

Final live pilot health passed after restoring the original adaptive settings.
A multi-turn counting check had 567 prompt tokens but only 15 selected latest
user tokens: all 40 scheduled layers streamed those 15 rows, admitted 105
experts and protected 1,604. Prefill and end-of-request adaptation also applied
261 and 114 swaps, respectively, without evicting protected experts; the pilot
remained healthy with those 1,604 still protected after idle maintenance. The
five implementation modules match byte-for-byte on both running ranks and the
workspace. Native `deepseek` serves on port 8000; TensorFold remains stopped.
Final state: `pilot-smoke.json`, `pilot-final-health.json`, `rank*-source.json`,
`pilot-changes.json`. `git diff --check` passed. Benchmark votes used separate
demand DBs; the live pilot resumed the original DB and its qualification request
contributed normally to that history.

## 2026-10-06 — 100 resident loads and fully dynamic sector allocation

The expert arena already maps `(layer, expert)` to fixed-size slots. TP2 stores
9,400,320 bytes per slot per GPU; the peer stores the matching shard. Added
cross-layer transfers, a global demand-based initial allocation, and
`DSV41_DYNAMIC_EXPERTS`. Layer counts can grow/shrink without changing the total
9,400 residents or 90.1 GB arena. No fixed quotas or Mia discount remain in the
dynamic policy; six residents per layer is the routing minimum. Decode mask/LUT
addresses remain stable. Changed layers' eager compact prefill maps are rebuilt.

Full latest-user discovery now uses rank-0-authoritative token batches whose
unique cold experts fit the transient ring, allowing layers below the previous
224-resident capacity bound. Each row still executes all its chosen experts.
No decode streaming, new quantization, checkpoint download or TensorFold launch.
Both the policy and global-allocation version/settings are in the TP2 boot guard.

`DSV41_USER_PROMPT_MAX_LOADS=100` bounds logical resident expert replacements
across the entire request, including ordinary prefill/decode/end/idle adaptation.
Both TP ranks apply the same 100-expert plan to their own half weights. It is
neither a per-layer limit nor a total I/O limit: transient discovery stays
uncapped. Deferred absentees are not protected as if they were resident.

Same ordered 14-question MMLU-Pro set (seed 20261011, greedy max16), history
SHA256 `beef789badad39c7c29b2eb5b1576ad1ea4ef9cb1d2e189345cc2012d06858e9`,
normal adaptive swaps disabled, cache off. One new fixed-cap arm and one new
dynamic arm; compared with saved uncapped v2, without retries or answer-driven
tuning. This is exploratory reuse, not a holdout. Dynamic also removes the
discount and changes startup selection, so the comparison does not isolate
the effect of cross-layer transfers.

| Whole policy | Correct / 14 | Valid / 14 | Mean question wall time |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Saved uncapped prompt v2, fixed quotas + 5% discount | 12 | 14 | 8.659 s |
| Fixed quotas + 5% discount, cap 100 | 11 | 14 | 6.338 s |
| Dynamic allocation, no discount, cap 100 | 10 | 14 | 6.998 s |

The fixed cap lost psychology q2367 (I→F). Dynamic additionally lost math q8468
(E→I); all other direct answers matched the fixed-cap arm. Every request used
exactly 100 admissions. Dynamic made 95–100 cross-layer transfers per question
(mean 97.57), with resident counts 206–271 at startup and 203–260 after the
suite, total 9,400 throughout. Promotion mean was 0.327 s fixed-cap versus
0.451 s dynamic. Resident rebuild mean was 0.775 versus 2.201 s. Discovery
recorded 878–1,893 cold load events fixed-cap and 869–1,861 dynamic: the 100 cap
does not remove streaming discovery cost. Neither quality nor speed improved
over the fixed-cap arm on this small workload.

Three counting requests (one warmup, two timed) averaged 2.682 s fixed-cap and
3.382 s dynamic. Counting, Japanese conversion and the generated RLE function
passed, including seven empty/Unicode cases. No-user resident rebuilds at 6
and 426 tokens had exact logit delta zero. 57 focused checks and 17 mock-server
tests passed. A separate six-token real-weight TP2 gate forced three discovery
batches with six residents and eight transient slots: both ranks exactly
matched an all-resident MoE, max absolute delta 0, resident directory unchanged.
The first attempt to run that gate beside the live arena failed CUDA context
initialization with OOM on both ranks; the successful gate ran during restart.

At the user's explicit request, dynamic allocation stays enabled despite the
measured regression. Original production history and ordinary adaptive settings
are restored for live evaluation; benchmark demand files are separate. No
parameter search or quality-based rollback. Protocol, all responses, timings,
source hashes, batch gate and live qualification are in
`results/dynamic-experts-20261006/`; the fixed-cap comparison is in
`results/user-prompt-cap-100-20261006/`.

Final live qualification passed with the original production DB and ordinary
adaptation enabled. The 567-token multi-turn request selected only 15 latest
user tokens, admitted 89 experts and protected 1,599. Ordinary adaptation used
the remaining 11 loads: final total 100, remaining budget zero, resident total
still 9,400. Both ranks passed the 145-field boot guard; seven implementation
modules match the workspace byte-for-byte. `deepseek` is healthy on port 8000
with context 524,288 and dynamic mode retained. TensorFold's stop marker remains.

The launcher twice returned curl exit 23 after reporting healthy startup:
`curl | head` under `pipefail` stopped reading the enlarged health response.
`dual-up.sh` now reads the complete response before truncating its display,
using the configured bind address; `bash -n` and `git diff --check` passed.
The failed display exits and successful independent health checks are retained.

## 2026-10-06 — Resident prefill with dynamic allocation retained

The custom-harness incident had 15,434 total prompt tokens and 9,847 selected
latest-user tokens. Discovery was still running after more than 113 seconds,
before the first answer token. Role selection had not included every token,
but mixed chunks entered the host streaming path and full discovery cold reads
were unbounded. The 100-load limit covered resident replacements only. The
incident record contains aggregate counters, not the user's prompt.

At the user's request, `DSV41_USER_PROMPT_STREAM=0` is now persisted on both
nodes. Dynamic allocation no longer requires prompt streaming. The resident
replacement budget remains active when streaming is off; previously its
disabled feature flag also disabled that budget. Global startup/adaptation,
the six-resident layer floor, no fixed quotas/discounts, and the total 9,400
resident experts remain. Prompt discovery and the extra first-answer rebuild
are off. Policy versions: user prompt 5, dynamic allocation 3.

Two predeclared synthetic counting requests used normal production adaptation,
the original history DB, greedy max32 and thinking off. Both returned the exact
sequence 1 through 10. The cold 38-token request took 8.553 s including initial
graph warmup (prefill 6.699 s); the 10,014-token request took 41.326 s (prefill
40.465 s). Both had zero discovery loads, zero streamed rows/batches and zero
store resolves, and remained within 100 resident replacements after normal
adaptation completed. Neither rebuilt prefill for prompt priority. These are
operational checks, not a quality benchmark or a matched speed comparison with
the incident. Resident compute still scales with prompt length; routed pruning
misses remain even when the streaming I/O miss counters are zero.

59 focused tests and 17 mock-server tests passed. Both TP2 ranks passed the
145-field boot guard and seven implementation module hashes matched the
workspace. The normal launcher exited successfully; TensorFold stayed stopped.
Artifacts: `results/dynamic-resident-20261006/`. At this stage RAM/disk/response
prefix caches were still off; the RAM restriction is addressed below.

## 2026-10-06 — RAM prefix reuse with dynamic expert allocation

The constant 0% prefix reuse was caused by the persisted `PREFIX_CACHE=0` and
an overly broad dynamic-mode boot guard inherited from prompt streaming.
RAM snapshots store encoder state, not expert-sector pointers. Resident
prefill can therefore reuse historical KV after global sector transfers, as
the original within-layer adaptive policy already did. Removed the RAM-cache
restriction for dynamic allocation; prompt streaming still requires caches off.
Disk/response caching and prefill graphs remain outside this prototype.
Dynamic policy version 4 and `PREFIX_CACHE=1` are in the TP2 config guard.

Three predeclared synthetic counting requests used native TP2, normal
production adaptation/history, no prompt streaming, cap100, greedy max32,
thinking off and seed 20261013. Both ranks applied the same global plans.

| Request | Prompt tokens | Cached tokens | Prefill | Wall time |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Cold base, includes graph warmup | 2,289 | 0 | 13.548 s | 15.319 s |
| Exact repeat | 2,289 | 2,289 (100%) | 0.381 s | 1.346 s |
| Extended conversation | 2,329 | 2,289 (98.3%) | 2.364 s | 2.927 s |

All three returned the exact sequence 1 through 10. Expert generation advanced
0→1→2→3, with 100 resident replacements per request and 9,400 residents
throughout. Discovery loads, streamed rows and store resolves remained zero;
there was no priority rebuild. These verify cache use across changing resident
sets, not equality with fresh prefill under a new selection or general quality.
The cold timing includes compilation; it is not a steady-state throughput arm.

40 focused cache/media/disk/global/prompt tests and four prefix-state function
checks passed. The new CPU integration check applies a cross-layer transfer
on each TP rank, restores the historical encoder snapshot and verifies that
the new expert directory remains active. Both live ranks passed the 145-field
boot guard; seven module hashes match both ranks and the workspace. The pair
was restarted successfully with RAM prefix caching enabled on both nodes;
TensorFold remains stopped. `git diff --check` passed. Artifacts and all three
synthetic responses: `results/dynamic-prefix-20261006/`.

## 2026-10-06 — Correct the cap to streaming cold loads only

The requested cap was on temporary streaming loads. Applying it to generic
resident adaptation was a scope error. Prompt policy 6 removes the request-wide
resident clamp from `plan_swaps`, fixed-layer swaps and global transfers.
Prefill, periodic/urgent decode, request-end and idle adaptation now use their
existing rules. The previous cap could consume all 100 loads during prefill
and silently leave urgent adaptation with an empty plan.

Bounded latest-user streaming now selects cold experts before routing and
shares the allowed set and cold-load budget across TP2 ranks. Common transient
hits are free; each selected cold set fits the ring. Later calls use resident
routing once the cap is spent. This online policy prioritizes current rows,
not future layers. Streaming remains OFF in production; RAM prefix reuse and
fully dynamic allocation stay ON. The configured 100 cap is consequently
inactive during ordinary production adaptation.

70 focused tests passed, including the real store resolver with cap1 on both
simulated ranks, a 101-transfer resident plan after exhausting the stream budget,
and urgent decode planning with the exhausted budget. Two short live counting
checks (19 prompt tokens, greedy max32) returned the exact count: resident loads
were 160 then 110, with zero streaming loads. The repeat reused all 19 tokens.
Wall times were 6.664 s (cold graph warmup) and 1.636 s; no quality or speed gain
is claimed. Urgent adaptation is enabled at its existing 10%/~30-token threshold
and 150-token cooldown; the short live responses did not exercise its trigger.
Both ranks passed the 145-field boot guard and seven source hashes matched.
Artifacts: `results/stream-load-cap-20261006/`.


## 2026-10-06 — Live expert memory map

`/expert-map` now displays all 15,360 routed experts and all 9,584 arena sectors.
`/v1/expert-map` exposes the same snapshot as JSON. Resident, transient, missing
and actively loading experts have distinct states; a bounded completion history
keeps fast loads visible for three seconds. The page polls once per second,
with layer/expert inspection, sector view, zoom, pause and state highlighting.
It reads rank 0 CPU metadata without the generation lock, CUDA reads or new
collectives. This is an approximate live snapshot, not an independent TP peer
audit. Missing from the arena is not the same as a routed miss.

45 focused tests, five HTTP/map tests and 17 mock server tests passed. A short
19-token counting request returned the correct sequence while 30 map snapshots
were sampled: 98 loads recorded, active transfers observed, 9,400 final residents,
5,960 missing and zero streaming loads. Median snapshot fetch was 15.292 ms,
maximum 90.117 ms in this one check; no inference speed or quality improvement
is claimed. Browser checks covered both views, selection, zoom and pause/resume;
no console errors were reported. Inspection also caught live polling overwriting
number inputs; focused input text is now preserved and selection updates on input.

Image `expert-map-v8` is persisted on both nodes. The final HTML was hot-updated
in both running containers and included in the rebuilt image for future starts.
Artifacts, snapshots, test logs and screenshot: `results/expert-map-20261006/`.


## 2026-10-06 — Native TP2 and TTS coexistence

Reduced the native expert arena from 90.1 to 88.7 GB per node and transient
slots from 160 to 32. Capacity is now 9,435 sectors; all 9,400 resident experts
still fit. The arena allocation decreases by 149 sectors × 9,400,320 bytes =
1.401 GB per node. Dynamic allocation, prompt streaming OFF, 524,288 context
and RAM prefix caching remain unchanged. TTS uses a 3,072 token buffer,
reduced from 4,096 at the user's request; the 2,048 proposal was superseded.

Starting TTS after DeepSeek had loaded and generated failed at CUDA memory
initialization (`cudaMemGetInfo` reported out of memory), despite Linux reporting
reclaimable memory. This failed order is not evidence that the two services
cannot coexist. After stopping the pair, starting and warming TTS first, then
starting DeepSeek, both came up with the requested settings. No model downloads
or expert-budget reduction were needed. Both TP ranks passed the 145-field
config guard and loaded 9,400 residents.

One short text request and one short speech request were submitted concurrently.
The 19-token count prompt (max32, greedy) returned exactly 1 through 10 in
7.944 s including cold graph work. TTS returned a 153,644-byte mono 24 kHz PCM
WAV in 7.532 s. This checks coexistence, not sustained-load capacity, audio
quality or throughput improvement. Host MemAvailable afterward was about
7.8 GiB; swap was already in use. TTS buffer savings were not separately
measured. Artifacts: `results/tts-headroom-20261006/`.


## 2026-10-06 — One previously failed math question on the live engine

At the user's request, repeated only MMLU-Pro math question 7867, selected
before its new response from the earlier `score-uniform.json` run. Identical
prompt/options, greedy temperature 0, top_p 1, thinking off, max16; one request,
no retries, calibration or extra diagnostic prompts. The user explicitly
accepted this request contributing to production adaptation.

Earlier frozen uniform allocation answered A (-75.98), incorrect. Current live
dynamic allocation answered J (-153.59), matching the dataset key, in 2.723 s.
The response was a valid single letter with stop termination. This is one
historical failure recovered, not an overall benchmark score or a causal
quality estimate: history, placement and other serving settings differ, and
the question was selected because it previously failed. Exact protocol, raw
response and before/after health: `results/single-math-20261006/`.


## 2026-10-06 — Package the learned distribution for fresh starts

Captured the idle generation-44 working set: 9,400 exact resident expert IDs,
179–285 residents per layer, plus the current aggregate request-unit counts and
router-score mass. The 231 KiB `profiles/learned-experts-v1.npz` includes no
prompts, responses, KV caches or model weights. Its companion JSON records the
layer counts, capture generation and checksum. The source history includes the
single math retest the user explicitly authorized earlier; this export does not
claim to be an uncontaminated benchmark arm or a generally optimal distribution.

Fresh dynamic score/request-mode starts use the bundle only if the local demand
DB path does not exist. At the 9,400 budget the exact captured map is restored;
other budgets use normal global selection from the seeded demand blend. The
same history initializes the model accumulators, so ordinary future write-back
creates the new user's own DB. Existing DBs always bypass the bundle, even if
incompatible or unreadable; explicit seed opt-out also bypasses it. The original
trace remains the adaptation prior. No local production DB was replaced.

Rank 0 alone reads the seed and sends it in the existing ranking broadcast;
seed version, enabled flag and checksum join the boot guard. The example config
now selects 0.61 keep, dynamic score placement and compatible cache switches.
32 CPU tests passed, including the real boot-ranking segment with conflicting
peer history, exact expert IDs, budget resizing, opt-out, invalid seed rejection
and local-history precedence. Both nodes' new `learned-seed-v9` images load the
identical seed checksum and 9,400 IDs in an offline CPU check. Both launch files
point to that image for the next restart. The live engine and TTS were not
restarted, and no inference/quality benchmark was run for this change.
Artifacts: `results/default-distribution-20261006/`.


## 2026-10-06 — 1,024-token prefill chunks beside TTS

After the live 20,855-token session exhausted host headroom with 2,048-token
chunks, reduced only `DSV41_PREFILL_CHUNK` to 1024 on both nodes. The 524,288
context capacity, 88.7 GB arena, 32 transient slots, all 9,400 residents, dynamic
allocation, prefix caching and TTS max-seq-len 3072 remain unchanged. No watchdog
relaxation or CUDA-cache-reclamation code was added.

A bounded text-only memory check used a copied demand DB: 20,775 prompt tokens
with no cached prefix, then a 20,801-token extension producing 319 tokens while
TTS synthesized one short sentence pair. Full prefill took 38.475 s; extension
reused 20,480 tokens (98.5%) and prefilled in 2.646 s. Both text responses met
their simple format checks, TTS returned a 399,404-byte WAV, and both ranks
remained healthy. The main host was sampled every 0.25 s: minimum MemAvailable
6.948 GB, final 7.404 GB. This is one memory coexistence check, not a matched
speed comparison, quality benchmark or a guarantee for 524k/vision workloads.
An urgent decode pass also occurred (64 swaps at output token 187), without
exhausting the reserve.

The production demand file remained byte-identical through the test. The test
instance was stopped and production relaunched from that original history.
Artifacts and memory samples: `results/memory-chunk-20261006/`.


## 2026-10-06 — Peer-only vision and 100 more dynamic residents

Added optional `DSV41_VISION_MODE=peer` for TP2. Rank 1 keeps the vision tower,
aligner and delimiter embeddings; rank 0 keeps only metadata for input preparation.
Both ranks exchange encoding status before broadcasting the complete image span.
The boot guard includes ownership mode, enabled state and protocol version; an
owner load/encode failure fails the pair rather than leaving the head waiting for
an absent tensor. Text-only requests have no added vision collective.

A standalone paired-GPU probe compared replicated and peer-only splice using
synthetic patch tensors at 546×546 (184 embedding rows) and 1176×1344 (926 rows).
Seven measured iterations per mode followed two warmups, alternating mode order,
with synchronized timings covering the slower rank. Every output was bit-exact.
Median replicated→peer times were 57.588→57.615 ms (+0.047%) and
496.262→462.887 ms (−6.73%). These are tower/splice timings, not full-request
throughput measurements. Dropping rank 0's tower released exactly 970,536,960
allocated bytes. No inference history was read or modified by that probe.

Added `DSV41_RESIDENT_EXPERTS` for an exact global dynamic budget, checked against
the routing floor/model capacity and included in the boot guard. This avoids
rounding the intended 9,500 to a multiple of 40 through `PRUNE_KEEP`. Static
allocation retains its existing budget semantics. The existing resident-capacity
check still requires the complete selected set to fit on each TP rank.

Local configuration uses 9,500 residents, arena 89.7 GB, 32 transient slots,
Engram caches 256 MiB / 1,024 MiB and peer-only vision. The extra resident weights
cost 940,032,000 bytes per rank. Cache budgets free 805,306,368 bytes on rank 0
and 3,221,225,472 on rank 1; combined with removed vision weights, this exceeds
the 1 GB arena increase by about 0.776 GB / 2.221 GB respectively. These are
allocation-budget differences, not guarantees about peak available memory.
26 focused CPU tests passed (vision ownership/error ordering, exact budget,
learned-seed selection and global residency). Artifacts: `results/peer-vision-20261006/`.

An API smoke check with a synthetic red square returned `Red` while TTS returned
a valid 126,764-byte WAV. It used a copied demand database; production history
remained byte-identical. At 0.25 s sampling, rank 0 MemAvailable stayed at least
7.701 GB during this short concurrent check. Both ranks loaded all 9,500 residents
and agreed on all 152 guarded fields; logs confirmed 256/1,024 MiB Engram caches.
The isolated test was stopped before restarting against the original production
history. This does not measure long-context multimodal headroom or quality gains
from the additional experts, nor decode-speed effects of the smaller row caches.


## 2026-10-06 — Increase the live dynamic budget to 9,550

Raised the exact resident budget from 9,500 to 9,550 and each arena from
89.7 to 90.2 GB. The extra 50 TP expert shards use 470,016,000 bytes per node.
Kept 32 transient slots, peer-only vision, 256/1,024 MiB Engram caches, 1,024-token
prefill chunks and the 524,288 context limit. Both ranks restarted, loaded all
9,550 residents and agreed on 152 guarded fields; the API and expert map confirmed
9,550 residents (180–292 per layer at startup). Production demand history remained
byte-identical through the restart, and TTS remained running. No inference or
quality benchmark was run for this configuration-only increase. Artifacts:
`results/residents-9550-20261006/`.


## 2026-10-06 — Reassign 24 transient sectors to residents

Reduced `TRANSIENT_SLOTS` from 32 to the supported minimum of 8 and increased
`DSV41_RESIDENT_EXPERTS` from 9,550 to 9,574. The 90.2 GB arena stays unchanged:
9,574 residents + 12 spare resident slots + 8 transient slots + 1 null slot =
9,595 sectors. Streaming, critical rescue and prefill replicas are off; normal
global adaptation overwrites donor resident slots directly and does not consume
the transient reserve. This configuration does not establish capacity for a
future unbounded streaming workload.

Both ranks loaded all 9,574 residents, passed the existing 152-field config guard
and became ready; the peer launch environment was also checked for the matching
8-slot reserve. API and expert map confirmed the new allocation. Learned demand
history remained byte-identical and TTS remained running. No inference benchmark
was run for this configuration-only change. Artifacts:
`results/residents-9574-20261006/`.


## 2026-10-06 — One live retest of computer-science question 10632

Retested the exact saved MMLU-Pro prompt and option order once with the live
9,574-resident dynamic engine, temperature 0, top_p 1, thinking disabled and
max_tokens 16. It returned `H` (incorrect; frozen key `F`) in 4.874 s, with 168
prompt tokens and one output token. Historical custom passes both answered `I`
(incorrect); Mia's two saved passes answered `H` (incorrect); the official API's
two saved passes answered `F` (correct). This item did not improve to a correct
answer. No repetition or alternative prompt was tried, and the reference
endpoints were not rerun. The user accepted the single request's contribution
to live adaptation. Prompt identity, protocol, response and health snapshots:
`results/single-cs10632-20261006/`.

At the user's request, two additional identical live attempts returned `H` /
`H`, both incorrect (0.963 s / 0.798 s). Each reused all 168 prompt tokens from
the RAM prefix cache, with adaptation active (reported generations 108 / 109).
They are cached repeats, not independent full-prefill evaluations of the updated
resident sets. Across the three live attempts, correctness was 0/3. Raw responses,
health and protocol are in the `attempt-2/` and `attempt-3/` subdirectories of
`results/single-cs10632-20261006/`. No further requests were sent.


## 2026-10-06 — One live retest of law question 1911

One request using the exact historical MMLU-Pro prompt and option order,
temperature 0, top_p 1, thinking disabled and max_tokens 16 returned `F`
(incorrect; frozen key `A`) in 3.071 s. Historical custom passes both returned
`A` (correct), Mia's two passes returned `C` (incorrect), and the official API's
two passes returned `A` (correct). This is a worse result on this individual
question than the earlier custom runs; it does not isolate the effects of
resident count, learned history or other intervening settings. No repeated
request or reference-endpoint rerun was made. Protocol, paired historical
answers, response and health snapshots: `results/single-law1911-20261006/`.

One user-requested repeat of 1911 returned `F` again (incorrect) in 0.878 s.
Reported request routing misses fell from 31.31% to 9.56%, and score-weighted
misses from 34.09% to 5.52%. However, the repeat reused all 405 prompt tokens;
recorded routing selections were 15,552 versus 66,582 on the first request.
These rates cover different executed work and do not establish a reduction on
fresh prefill of the full question. Reported expert generation advanced from
111 to 112. Artifacts: `results/single-law1911-20261006/attempt-2/`.


## 2026-10-06 — Thinking-on then thinking-off on law question 1911

Ran one user-requested best-case adaptation probe on the original question:
thinking on at effort 75, temperature 0/top_p 1, with a bounded 4,096-token
reasoning-plus-answer budget; then the exact historical thinking-off request
with max_tokens 16. Neither request included any answer or reasoning from the
preceding response. Prompt-template rendering differed near the beginning;
both runs reported zero cached prompt tokens without changing cache settings.

The thinking run used all 4,096 tokens for reasoning and returned no final answer
(finish=length), taking 148.695 s. It is incomplete, not a scored wrong answer.
During decode, six urgent passes loaded 150 experts in total, and three periodic
passes loaded 41. Prefill and post-response adaptation also remained active.

The subsequent thinking-off run answered `A` correctly in 4.703 s. Against the
original fresh thinking-off attempt (`F`, incorrect), request routing misses
fell from 31.31% to 5.74%, and score-weighted misses from 34.09% to 3.12%.
Both off runs executed 66,582 recorded routing selections and reused zero prompt
tokens. This is a positive single-item warmup observation, not a general quality
result or isolation of urgent adaptation: previous repeats, all other adaptation
paths and run-to-run variation remain confounders. The truncated thinking pass
does not establish whether thinking would eventually finish correctly. The
engine remained healthy. Artifacts: `results/law1911-thinking-pair-20261006/`.


## 2026-10-06 — Repeat thinking after the successful direct answer

One further thinking-on attempt of law question 1911 used exactly the prior
request body and rendered token IDs: effort 75, temperature 0, top_p 1, shared
reasoning/answer cap 4,096. The server default effort was confirmed as 75
(high); 60 maps to medium. The request did not contain prior reasoning or an
answer, and reported zero cached prompt tokens.

It again exhausted all 4,096 tokens in reasoning without a final answer,
finish=length, in 149.134 s (previous thinking attempt: 148.695 s). Treat this
as incomplete, not an incorrect selected option. Routing misses were 5.54%
and score-weighted misses 3.60%, versus 7.38% / 5.00% on the previous thinking
attempt. Better routing coverage did not make this bounded effort-75 attempt
finish. The earlier fresh thinking-off attempt had answered correctly, so the
observed additional thinking was unproductive within this budget; this does
not establish how a larger budget or a lower effort would behave. No further
inference requests were sent. Engine health remained OK.
Artifacts: `results/law1911-thinking-repeat-20261006/`.


## 2026-10-06 — Lower thinking effort to 50 for law question 1911

One follow-up used the same question, temperature 0, top_p 1 and 4,096-token
cap, with effort reduced from 75 to 50 and thinking explicitly enabled.
The prompt-debug endpoint confirmed thinking=true and effort=50. This was a
per-request setting; the server default remains 75.

The run finished normally in 17.397 s, using 411 reasoning tokens (413 completion
tokens total), and answered `C`, incorrect against the frozen key `A`. It reused
zero cached prompt tokens. Routing misses were 4.67%, score-weighted misses 2.79%.
Unlike both effort-75 attempts, it did not exhaust the budget; however, the lower
effort did not reproduce the earlier correct thinking-off answer. This is one
sequential live-adaptation comparison, not an isolated effort-only experiment.
No additional inference requests were made. Engine health remained OK.
Artifacts: `results/law1911-thinking-effort50-20261006/`.


## 2026-10-06 — Thinking effort 60 on law question 1911

One user-requested run used the same question, temperature 0, top_p 1 and
4,096-token cap with thinking explicitly enabled and effort 60. Prompt-debug
confirmed both settings. It finished normally in 60.963 s, using 1,549 reasoning
tokens (1,551 completion tokens total), and answered `C`, incorrect against the
frozen key `A`. Zero prompt tokens were cached. Request routing misses were
4.01%, score-weighted misses 2.42%. This completed within the cap, unlike the two
effort-75 runs, but used more reasoning than effort 50 (411 tokens) and selected
the same incorrect option. Sequential live adaptation makes this an exploratory
comparison rather than an isolated effect of effort. The server default remains
75 and the engine remained healthy. No additional inference requests were made.
Artifacts: `results/law1911-thinking-effort60-20261006/`.

### 2026-10-06 — Predictive prefill prototype: CPU cost and shadow selection

Added an optional bounded nearest-neighbor predictor that feeds provisional
prefill demand into the existing global ranking policy before model execution.
Actual post-prefill adaptation remains in place. Predictions never enter the
persisted demand history; measured observations are folded by the normal path.
This is an approximation, not an exact calculation of deep-layer routing from
input tokens. Apply remains opt-in pending evidence of selection quality.

Validation used copied demand history and separate predictor banks. Production
history remained byte-identical to the pre-test backup. The live test overrides
minimum examples to 1 to exercise the path; the normal minimum is 8. Every request
used synthetic inventory notes, thinking off, greedy decoding, max 16 output
tokens, and returned `READY`. These are integration checks, not answer-quality
benchmarks.

| Shadow request | Prompt / cached tokens | Prediction + planning | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cold example | 10,260 / 0 | 12.250 ms | Collected first example; no prediction |
| Similar fresh example | 10,260 / 0 | 36.859 ms | Predicted 189 promotions vs 202 from actual demand |
| Cached extension | 10,349 / 10,240 (98.95%) | 1.355 ms | No similar suffix; safely skipped prediction |

On the similar fresh example, feature cosine was 0.999876, mean demand total
variation was 0.1113, promotion precision 76.72%, and recall 71.78%. Only two exact
incoming/outgoing pairs matched. The 145 shared incoming experts do not establish
quality equivalence: near-identical text still produced different routing after
normal adaptation changed the residents. Keep this negative result when considering
lower similarity thresholds or promoting the prototype to an apply default.
The cached-extension example had cosine 0.5213 to the two full-prefill examples;
reusing a prefix does not make new-suffix routing interchangeable with full-prefill
routing. The bank needs relevant continuation examples as well.

Observation/evaluation/persistence took 31.038, 81.101 and 78.927 ms respectively.
Request wall times were 24.657, 14.471 and 2.467 s. These are sequential requests
with different warmup/cache/residency states, not an A/B speed or quality claim.

The separate CPU feature+neighbor microbenchmark (128 entries, five timed runs
after warmup) measured medians 1.715 ms at 10k new tokens, 16.151 ms at 200k context
with 2k new tokens, and 22.424 ms at 524,288 context with 5,243 new tokens. It excludes
planning, expert weight I/O and model execution. Bank array storage was 17,301,504
bytes. No GPU kernel was introduced. Focused unit coverage: 51 passing tests.

Artifacts: `results/predictive-prefill-20261006/` (`feature-bench.json`,
`live-summary.json`, per-request health snapshots, isolated histories and logs).

A separate apply-mode integration probe restored the original pre-test demand
history and used the isolated bank above (three entries, minimum 1). A fresh
10,260-token near-variant loaded 362 predicted experts before prefill in
1,167.950 ms, following 41.177 ms prediction/planning. It returned `READY`, with
7.79% request routing misses and 6.88% score-mass misses (cold shadow probe:
21.81% / 20.26%). Prefill took 18.421 s, request wall time 19.702 s. Observed demand
TV against prediction was 0.08198; recording took 24.756 ms. Post-prefill correction
remained active. This validates the distributed early-load path but uses nearby
training examples and a trivial answer; it is not proof of preserved answer quality
or a controlled speed comparison. Weight I/O is much larger than feature cost.

Normal service uses the new image with `DSV41_PREDICTIVE_PREFILL=shadow`, minimum
8, and an empty production bank. It retains the original production history,
9,574 residents, eight transient sectors, prefix caching, peer vision and Engram
cache sizes. Synthetic predictor banks are not copied into the production bank.

### 2026-10-06 — Repository checkpoint and portable profile

Compared the local serving environment with `.env.example` using resolved
adaptation settings, not just raw variable names: adaptation now agrees exactly.
The example selects high sensitivity/prior 4, 9,574 dynamic residents in a 90.2 GB
arena with eight transient slots, a 524,288-token allocation, peer vision,
256/1,024 MiB Engram caches, native dense precision, and speculative depth 3/5.
RAM prefix reuse is explicit. Disk/post-response caches remain disabled; the
300-second disk-save interval is documented as inactive in this mode. Experimental
prediction stays opt-in in the template; the local server collects in shadow mode.
Machine addresses, credentials, optional ablation weights and local image tags
are not copied into the template. Older raw pruning overrides are omitted because
the adaptation knobs derive their effective values.

The README was reduced to setup, operation and the current profile. Detailed
adaptation notes and historical measurements remain under `docs/`, including
negative results. Pre-commit checks: 168 passed, three CUDA-only tests skipped
with GPUs hidden to avoid interfering with live serving. This comprises 117
focused unit tests, 30 persistence/response tests, four prefix-cache function
tests, and 17 mock-API tests. Shell syntax, relative documentation links and diff
whitespace checks passed. No new live quality benchmark was run for this commit.


### 2026-10-06 — Separate engine-only and TTS example budgets

The live 9,574-resident / 90.2 GB setup reserves room for TTS. The portable
engine-only example now proposes 9,800 residents and 92.3 GB per node, while
documenting the existing setup as the TTS coexistence profile. Live `.env` and
services were not changed. This is a capacity calculation, not a new memory
stress or answer-quality result.

At 9,400,320 bytes per TP expert shard, 92.3 GB provides 9,818 sectors:
9,800 residents + 8 transient + 1 null + 9 spare. The extra 226 resident shards
occupy 2,124,472,320 bytes per node; the total arena grows by 2.1 decimal GB
(its spare capacity decreases). Both nodes need headroom, regardless of which
node hosts TTS. The larger configuration has not been launched or validated
under sustained long-context load.

### 2026-10-06 — Live throughput for the README

Ran seven bounded requests without restarting or changing the live configuration:
one warmup plus two measured runs each for code and prose, then one random 8K
request. TP2, 9,574 residents, arena 90.2 GB per node, 524,288 context allocation,
1,024-token prefill chunks, native MXFP4 experts, dense FP4 off, native attention
abliteration overlay enabled, DSpark depth 3/5, router-score adaptation high/prior
4, RAM prefixes on, disk/response caches off, prediction in shadow mode. The TTS
service stayed loaded; no concurrent speech request was submitted by the bench.
This measures the existing TTS-sized profile, not the larger engine-only example.

Harness: `bench/bench.py`, model `deepseek`, temperature 0, top_p 0.95, thinking
off, `ignore_eos=true`. Code/prose requested 256 output tokens and random requested
128; every measured response reached exactly that length. Fresh prompt tags (or
random words) yielded zero cached tokens in every measured request. Normal
adaptation and predictor observation stayed active and learned from the traffic.

| Workload | Prompt / output tokens | Decode tok/s, measured runs | Median TTFT | Routing misses, measured runs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LRU Python module: TTL, thread safety, callbacks and pytest suite | 62 / 256 | 26.480, 27.263 (median 26.872) | 0.889 s | 4.99%, 3.87% |
| Coastal-ecosystem essay | 45 / 256 | 19.206, 17.833 (median 18.519) | 0.875 s | 5.64%, 4.73% |
| Random 8K | 8,177 / 128 | 23.182 (one run) | 21.360 s | 27.81% |

Random-input prefill took 21.345 s, or 383.09 input tok/s. Code/prose warmup decode
rates were 26.89 and 18.09 tok/s, excluded from the medians. Median engine
`accept_len_mean` was 2.82 for code and 1.92 for prose; random was 2.72. This metric
includes the verified token: it is output tokens per verification step, not a
count of accepted draft tokens alone. Engine store hit rate was 1.0 while routing
misses remained nonzero; store hits must not be presented as complete expert
coverage. Measured code/prose runs had no urgent decode swap pass.

Client decode rate is `(completion_tokens - 1) / (total_s - first_content_time)`;
it excludes TTFT and uses usage tokens, not streamed chunk count. The random
prompt's high miss rate and the varying output tokens per step illustrate why
throughput depends on workload and learned residency. All outputs were token-capped,
so these measurements do not qualify complete code or answer quality. This is a
small sequential serving benchmark, not a matched EXL3 comparison or proof of a
regression/speedup against earlier configurations. The final health check was OK
and idle. No settings were changed to obtain the numbers.

Reproduction: code/prose use `--osl 256 --warmup 1 --runs 2 --temperature 0
--ignore-eos`, with labels `readme-20261006-code` and `readme-20261006-prose`.
Random uses `--workload random --isl 8192 --osl 128 --warmup 0 --runs 1
--temperature 0 --ignore-eos --label readme-20261006-random`. Live history can
change the outputs and timing between executions. The artifact directory records the Git identity, source hashes and serving image
identity; the benchmark used the already-running service.

Artifacts: `results/readme-throughput-20261006/`: per-workload JSON, combined
`summary.json`, `run.py`, warmup log and before/after health snapshots.

### 2026-10-06 — Investigating the apparent speculative acceptance drop

The earlier code result (2026-10-01) used temperature 0.6 and 512 output tokens;
the README run above used greedy decoding and 256 tokens. Their respective
`accept_len_mean` values, 3.72 and 2.82, are **not acceptance probabilities**.
They are mean leading accepted drafts plus one, before final output truncation.
The controller also changed its depth mix: five-draft steps were 256/421 (60.8%)
in the old runs and 42/182 (23.1%) in the newer runs. Its decisions depend on
relative measured step time as well as acceptance. Reported five/three step-cost
ratios were roughly 1.17 before and 1.25 in the newer greedy runs. Runtime changes
can therefore change this metric indirectly, even without changing draft logits.

Replayed the old request protocol on the current live engine: same prompt salt
(`run`), temperature 0.6, top_p 0.95, thinking off, 512-token limit, EOS honored,
one warmup and three measured runs. Normal adaptation remained active for this
replay. All three reached 512 tokens. Yields were **2.83, 3.32, 3.21** (median
3.21), at **26.85, 28.84, 29.12 tok/s**. Matching request settings did not recover
the entire old result; stochastic outputs and expert history were not identical.

Then isolated weight and attention-width options using the same 62-token LRU
cache prompt, seeds 42/43, temperature 0.6, top_p 0.95, 512 output tokens,
`ignore_eos=true`, thinking off, and fixed **five-draft** verification. Each arm
had a 64-token warmup. All four arms used the same copied demand history, 9,574
residents, and identical expert-to-slot maps (checked from `/v1/expert-map`).
Swaps, predictive prefill and prefix caching were disabled for these arms;
generation stayed zero and no decode adaptation passes ran. The production
demand file's SHA-256 stayed unchanged throughout these isolated tests. TP2,
90.2 GB/node, 524288 context allocation, 1024-token prefill chunks and the TTS
service remained in place. Attention FP4 also changes the DSpark attention
projections; it is not a main-backbone-only switch.

| Attention / overlay / index_topk | Tokens per step, seeds 42 / 43 | Mean ms/step | Mean client decode tok/s |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Native / on / 1024 | 3.85 / 3.78 | 122.28 | 31.07 |
| Native / off / 1024 | 3.36 / 3.70 | 126.06 | 28.00 |
| FP4 `attn,wo_a` / off / 1024 | 3.61 / 3.99 | 114.34 | 32.95 |
| Native / off / 512 | 3.36 / 3.70 | 120.73 | 29.24 |

Findings and limits:

- Removing abliteration did **not** recover acceptance on this workload. Keep
  this negative result: its plausible main-model/drafter mismatch was not
  supported by these two samples. No answer-quality improvement was tested.
- `index_topk=512` produced byte-identical answer text, identical step counts
  and identical acceptance metrics to 1024 for both seeds, while reducing mean
  step time by **4.23%**. Wider attention contributed runtime cost here, not a
  direct draft-agreement loss. This short test says nothing about long-context
  quality at 512 versus 1024.
- Attention FP4 reduced mean step time by **9.30%** against native stock and
  changed generated text and acceptance. It is a measured speed/precision
  tradeoff, not evidence of better model quality or a general acceptance gain.
- The old/new headline mixed request settings, model weights, residency and a
  timing-sensitive draft-depth policy. It cannot establish a 24% intrinsic
  acceptance-probability regression or uniquely assign the historical gap to one
  change. Fixed-depth results demonstrate that long accepted blocks remain
  possible; a same-token-prefix evaluation would be needed to isolate intrinsic
  draft agreement from different generated trajectories.

The user requested keeping abliteration disabled regardless of this result:
`.env` now clears `DSV41_ABLIT_WOB`. Normal dynamic depth 3/5, native dense
precision, index_topk 1024, adaptive loading and shadow prediction are the
restoration configuration. Neither the overlay file nor the checkpoint was
modified. Artifacts: `results/acceptance-investigation-20261006/`, including
protocols, per-seed outputs/stats, all four maps, summary and launch logs. The
first wrapper's immediate idle assertion raced end-of-request cleanup after its
completed baseline; continuation waits for idle. Its original restore assertion
also expected overlay-on, superseded by the user's overlay-off instruction.

### 2026-10-06 — Decode diff audit and urgent-monitoring evidence

Compared the Oct 1 baseline code (`7df4e0d`, adjacent to the saved throughput
run) with the current checkout. The old result does not record an immutable
runtime source identity, so this is a source audit, not a complete binary bisect.
AST comparisons found the original `DepthPolicy`, `sample_probs`, and sequential
accept/reject loop unchanged. The DSpark `_draft` body also matches after removing
the inactive `TREE_PROBE` branch and mapping `COMPUTE_CONF` back to `SPEC_CONF`.
Live inspection confirmed confidence depth, lookup drafts, bypass, separate TP
draft head and layer streaming are all off. Dynamic residency still uses the
existing device LUT in the resident decode path. The expert-map endpoint reads
CPU state, not CUDA routing masks.

The source diff adds urgent counter readback on each verification burst, a host
Engram row cache, and score-miss totals in the fused routing-statistics kernel.
These are costs to distinguish from numerical changes, not demonstrated major
regressions. Historical isolated urgent-monitoring results were already saved:
`results/urgent-overhead-20261003/urgent-rank0.json` and `summary.json`. Warmed
512-token greedy prose, pinned depth 3, swaps suppressed, measured ABBA:
**24.485 tok/s off versus 24.720 on**; all outputs and both ranks agreed exactly.
This small difference is not evidence of a speedup, but the test found no slowdown.
Read the retained `urgent-adapt` Docker image without launching a model and
confirmed AST-identical `_decode_adapt_due`, `decode_miss_snapshot`, and
`UrgentAdaptWindow` against current code. Keep monitoring enabled: a `.tolist()`
alone is insufficient evidence to remove useful urgent loading. This historical
test used FP4 attention and an older memory profile; it does not quantify overhead
for every current workload. Actual expert-loading pauses are separate from
monitor-only cost.

Another historical comparison mismatch: every Oct 1 measured code run restored
**62/62 prefix tokens**, whereas the newer README runs restored **0/62**. This
changes prefill execution/cache state; it is not a demonstrated explanation for
decode acceptance by itself. Historical Engram cache tests also showed modest,
workload-dependent effects (cold cache -2.55% to +0.07%, warm -1.30% to +1.85%),
not a universal improvement or a demonstrated cause of the current gap.
No serving settings or inference code were changed for this read-only audit.

### October 6: old-code rollback with native attention

At the user's request, deployed `7df4e0d` in an isolated worktree/image while
preserving the current checkout. Both TP2 nodes use image
`deepseek-v41-flash-spark:oct1-baseline-7df4e0d` (image ID
`841a5f91572fbe99c230906bb952485c4fc935be348a7e03cf482896e155859a`).
Native attention is retained (`DSV41_DENSE_FP4=off`), abliteration stays off,
and checkpoint index top-k is 512. Optional L2 prefetch is disabled because
that old implementation is incompatible with native FP8 weights. This is
therefore not a reproduction of the historical FP4-attention preset.

The old allocator loads 9,400 experts, 235 per layer, into an 89.0 GB arena.
Both ranks passed their config and prune-mask guards. It does not provide
cross-layer allocation or the expert-map endpoint. Vision is replicated;
TTS remains running. RAM prefix caching stays enabled and disk prefix caching
stays disabled. The old engine uses a separate compatible frequency-history
copy; SHA-256 checks confirmed the three production learning files were
unchanged after the switch. Configuration backup, deployment logs, health
snapshot, and history hashes are in `results/rollback-oct1-20261006/`.

Smoke test: thinking off, temperature 0, maximum 16 output tokens, prompt
`Reply with exactly READY.` returned `READY` (2 completion tokens). This
verifies serving only; no throughput or quality recovery is established by
this test.

Rollback code benchmark (`code-bench.json` in that directory): one warmup and
three measured 512-token generations, thinking off, temperature 0.6, normal
EOS, `--seed-salt run`, matching the earlier `old-settings.json` requests.
Sampling was unseeded and adaptation remained enabled. Measured decode rates
were 31.29, 35.31, and 31.52 tok/s; median **31.52 tok/s**, versus **28.84**
for the newer engine with the same request settings (+9.3%). Median reported
acceptance length was **3.23** versus **3.21**; median decode time per
speculative step was **99.71 ms** versus **108.27 ms**. All measured prompts
had zero cached tokens. The older October 1 FP4-attention result remains
37.34 tok/s with acceptance length 3.72 and fully cached 62-token prompts.

This rollback recovered throughput on this small workload without materially
recovering median acceptance length. It does not isolate a code regression:
expert allocation/history, attention index top-k, abliteration, host caches,
and adaptation behavior also differ from the newer-engine reference. Nor is
it an expert-map overhead experiment. Raw per-run depth distributions and
comparisons are saved in `comparison.json`. No quality claim follows.

### October 6: snapshot immediately before dynamic cross-layer allocation

Deployed retained `user-prompt-priority-v3` image, immediately preceding
`dynamic-experts-v4`, to locate the throughput change more narrowly. The two
hosts initially had different image IDs under the same tag; copied the local
image to the peer and verified both use
`sha256:0b0c45fdd6aa6f659916ff589190b9cfd8ef027dcdbcc3297d06c0e65f1c67eb`.
Source inspection confirms no dynamic-expert flag/global allocator, and swaps
remain within layers. Current tracked checkout is unchanged. The earlier
October 1 service configuration is backed up in
`results/pre-dynamic-bench-20261006/current.env`.

Retained native attention, top-k 512, no abliteration, 89.0 GB arena, 9,400
residents (235/layer), frequency ranking, depth 3/5, no confidence controller,
no host Engram cache, and no urgent adaptation. Prompt/layer streaming and disk
prefix caching remain off. Used an isolated copy of the same initial frequency
counts as the October 1 rollback; both ranks passed mask/config guards. The
inactive prompt-streaming load cap was set to unlimited. Original production
learning-file hashes remain unchanged; TTS remains running.

Same code workload, temperature 0.6, normal EOS, `--seed-salt run`, one warmup
and three measured 512-token generations, unseeded sampling, adaptation on:

| Version | Median decode tok/s | Median acceptance length | Median ms/step |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| October 1 code, native attention | 31.52 | 3.23 | 99.71 |
| Pre-dynamic v3, native attention | 32.17 | 3.36 | 99.82 |
| Previously measured newer live configuration | 28.84 | 3.21 | 108.27 |

Pre-dynamic measured runs were 32.17, 31.84, 33.00 tok/s, all with zero cached
prompt tokens. This small screen does not show an additional slowdown between
October 1 and the pre-dynamic snapshot under these settings. It narrows the
investigation toward later changes/settings but does not attribute the newer
reference's slowdown to dynamic allocation: that reference also differed in
index width, abliteration, expert ranking/residency and host cache/adaptation
settings. Dynamic depth and stochastic text prevent treating these as a fixed
GPU-work replay. Raw results, deployment logs and per-run depth statistics:
`results/pre-dynamic-bench-20261006/`. The pre-dynamic snapshot remains live.

### October 6: current code with dynamic residency disabled

Repeated the preceding pre-dynamic benchmark using `predictive-v11`, with
`DSV41_DYNAMIC_EXPERTS=0` and the same isolated initial frequency counts.
Native attention, top-k 512, no abliteration, 9,400 experts at 235/layer,
89.0 GB arena, zero host Engram cache, no urgent adaptation, and depth 3/5
were retained. Initial resident mask SHA-256 matched the pre-dynamic snapshot:
`9008dd660d034580005889d58f0341b9137d765aea190128846741fc8f2ffd03`.
Both ranks ran image
`sha256:0b425ba19b73597a355a200b175b4b04967d9faf1bfd1168901f46d6956727bc`;
its serving sources match the current checkout (only a test file differs).

One warmup, then three 512-token code generations at temperature 0.6 with
`--seed-salt run`, unseeded sampling, adaptation enabled: **31.60, 33.70,
30.08 tok/s**, median **31.60**, median acceptance length **3.19**. The
pre-dynamic median was 32.17 and October 1 native median 31.52. This short
screen does not establish a substantial regression in current code with fixed
layer allocation. Expert-map polling was active; this is not an isolated
map-overhead measurement. Config backups, logs and raw data are in
`results/current-static-bench-20261006/`.

### October 6: dynamic residency, verification depth, and live speed qualification

The current engine can retain dynamic allocation and match the October 1
native-attention throughput on the matched short code workload. No inference
kernel or depth-policy change was needed to reproduce that speed. This does
not identify a unique cause for every earlier slow run.

Added `tools/bench_dynamic_residency_depth_tp.py`, a disposable two-rank gate
using a single frozen dynamic map, the full five-token DSpark drafter at every
verification width, alternating mode order, and exact token/rank assertions.
The gate used native attention, top-k 1024, 9,574 experts selected from a copy
of the production score history (205–276 per layer), 90.2 GB arena, peer-only
vision, L2 prefetch 2 MiB, and no prefix reuse or adaptive swaps during timing.
It never wrote production history. This freezes placement for diagnosis only;
normal serving's adaptation was subsequently restored. Image/serving sources
were the same current `predictive-v11` image used in the preceding static test.

After warming both graph widths, two 384-token greedy runs per mode/workload:

| Mean engine decode tok/s | Fixed depth 3 | Fixed depth 5 | Automatic 3/5 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Code | 31.270 | 32.745 | 32.260 |
| Prose | 20.110 | 17.925 | 20.265 |

All modes produced identical greedy token sequences for each workload, on both
ranks, and the expert mask stayed unchanged. Automatic depth was 1.5% below
the better fixed code depth and within timing variation of the better prose
depth. Prose's fixed-depth acceptance length rose from 1.88 to 1.96 while
throughput fell 10.9% relative to fixed depth 3. Higher acceptance length alone
is not a reason to force depth 5. The existing controller chooses using
estimated tokens/second, before the next proposal, preserving the sampled
accept/reject rule; no confidence-policy experiment was enabled.

A fixed-depth-3 ABBA cache test on the same 384-token code output measured
31.24 tok/s with the host Engram cache off and 31.12 with a cold application
cache (256 MiB head / 1 GiB peer), a 0.4% difference. A warm-cache repeat was
31.04. Cache buffers were fully touched before timing; the OS page cache was
not dropped. Seeded 128-token sampled cache on/off runs were also token-identical.
This screen does not justify disabling the cache or blaming it for a large
regression. Eleven CPU depth-policy tests passed. Both ranks completed the
full gate successfully. Data: `results/dynamic-speed-investigation-20261006/`
(`depth-rank*.json`, `summary.json`, `rank*.log`).

Normal dynamic serving was then restored: original production score-history
path, 9,574 residents, native attention, top-k 1024, abliteration off, automatic
depth 3/5, urgent adaptation enabled, host Engram caches 256 MiB/1 GiB,
peer-only vision, RAM prefixes on, disk/response prefixes off, and predictive
prefill in shadow mode. TTS stayed running throughout. The following live
requests contribute normally to adaptation, unlike the isolated gate above.

The same 512-token code benchmark used for both rollbacks (temperature 0.6,
`--seed-salt run`, one warmup, three measured runs, normal EOS, unseeded
sampling) measured **31.44, 32.01, 32.76 tok/s**, median **32.01**. Compare
October 1 native **31.52**, pre-dynamic native **32.17**, and current fixed
allocation **31.60**. Median acceptance length was 3.28; per-run lengths were
3.81, 3.23, 3.28. Global transfers were active at prefill/end boundaries, and
urgent monitoring was enabled (no urgent pass was triggered in these measured
requests). Decode request miss rate was 3.88%, 3.52%, 3.19%. This supports
retaining the current allocator and automatic depth policy rather than
sacrificing them to recover throughput. It is a small workload, not a universal
speed or quality-equivalence claim.

Reproducing the *original README benchmark settings* (256 tokens, greedy,
`--seed-salt readme-20261006-code`, ignore EOS, one warmup/two measured) on this
same restored engine gave **28.57 and 27.38 tok/s**, median **27.98**. The prior
README median was 26.87. Thus the 37.34 historical FP4/512-token sampled result
and the 26.87 native/256-token greedy result are not a matched code-regression
comparison. Precision, request settings/prompt tags, selected expert maps,
cache state and stochastic trajectories are confounded. Do not add percentages
from separate tests or attribute the full difference to dynamic allocation.

Functional qualification: exact 1–20 counting, Japanese `日本語もいける？`, and
a generated run-length encoder passing seven empty/ASCII/Unicode cases.
Repeating the Japanese request consecutively reused all 35 input tokens;
an intervening unrelated request correctly prevented that short-prefix reuse.
These checks are stronger than merely seeing HTTP 200 but do not establish
broad benchmark quality. A 20-request local expert-map latency probe had
15.87 ms median round trip (including JSON parsing) and 97.81 ms maximum;
it is not a page-open/page-closed throughput experiment. The map remained
available during live timing. Final live model: `deepseek`, current dynamic
engine; no lower-precision attention or fixed-depth workaround was deployed.

### October 7: re-enable the abliteration overlay

At the user's request, restored `DSV41_ABLIT_WOB` to
`/models/dsv41-wo-b-ablit/wo_b_l10_35.safetensors`. Both nodes have SHA-256
`5a777976d86d03b681fde951c08908bc49e3b243007e8cfed3c1934bcb07a2c5`.
The TP2 boot guard agreed, health reports `ablate_wob=true`, and a short
Japanese smoke request returned `おはよう`. Dynamic allocation, 9,574 residents,
native attention and top-k 1024 remain configured as before. No new throughput
claim: the preceding 32.01 tok/s measurement was with abliteration off.
Config backup and verification: `results/ablit-reenabled-20261007/`.

### October 7: memory pressure with TTS; smaller prefill chunks are provisional

At 14:42:09 UTC, rank 0's host-memory watchdog exited after MemAvailable
remained below its 2.5 GB floor for three seconds (2.4 GB at exit). NVIDIA
kernel logs had already reported `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` at 14:42:06–07. The
request had 55,020 input tokens and had generated at least 1,382 reasoning
tokens. This was a decode-time failure, not the configured context limit.
Rank 1 still had approximately 8.9 GiB available. TTS was running on rank 0's
node with approximately 5,753 MiB reported GPU memory.

Retained the 2.5 GB watchdog floor: lowering it releases no memory and would
not address the earlier driver allocation failure. Restarted with only local
`DSV41_PREFILL_CHUNK` changed from 1024 to 512; all 9,574 residents, native
attention, the abliteration overlay, and TTS remain enabled. Health confirms
512-token chunks. This roughly halves buffers linear in chunk length, but
there is no matched measurement of total GB saved, and no evidence yet that
retained prefill workspace caused the decode-time failure. Do not describe
this as a confirmed fix or a 50% reduction in total engine memory.

The user's harness resumed after restart: a 15,223-token full prefill plus
104 output tokens completed successfully, as did a 22,608-token request
with 192 output tokens (15,223 prefix tokens reused).
No competing synthetic request was submitted. This short observation does
not qualify the previously failing 55k-context workload. Diagnostic logs,
private config backup, and bounded memory samples are saved under
`results/memory-pressure-20261007/`.

### October 7: TensorFold-inspired router, prefetch and memory improvements

Source inspection suggested specialized router work, graph-cache management,
memory-aware prefill, and better overlap for weight reads. Implemented these
without changing the resident expert budget or native attention precision.
All engine tests used a **frozen copy** of the production score history and
suppressed saves; the production NPZ SHA-256 stayed unchanged throughout.
TTS stayed running. No model weights were downloaded or converted.

**Router:** retained the original padded FP32 cuBLAS projection and torch top-k
(including tie behavior), and fused gathering six selected scores, their sum
and normalization into one kernel. Its sum reproduces the current Torch CUDA
six-element reduction order. Across 400 random/extreme/tied-input cases at
1/2/4/6/8 rows, IDs, scores and normalized weights were bit-identical. The
existing real-checkpoint router test also passed. CUDA-graph microbenchmarks:
4 rows **51.82 -> 49.05 us**, 6 rows **52.46 -> 49.45 us**. This is a component
speedup, not a 6% total-engine claim. Full-router GEMV replacement remains a
separate numerical change; this implementation deliberately preserves it.

Initial full-engine screen (greedy, 160 output tokens, fixed draft depth 3,
two runs per variant in forward/reverse order, frozen 9,574-expert map,
65,536 allocated context, top-k 1024, native attention, overlay on): baseline
code/prose **27.84/22.11 tok/s**, fused tail **28.23/21.96**, fused tail plus
bulk prefetch 2 MiB **28.08/21.97**, bulk 4 MiB **28.15/21.90**. No clear
full-engine benefit from replacing the existing communication-site prefetch.
The first gate stopped at an overly strict long-prompt/post-EOS comparison;
its preceding matched router/prefetch trials were token-identical across
variants and both ranks. The next gate had a test-output-directory setup
failure on the peer; the driver now creates its output directory on each rank
and exits promptly after errors instead of hanging in NCCL teardown.

A second placement prefetches this layer's output-projection weights while
attention computes, using the hardware bulk hint. Final fixed-depth-3 screen,
192 output tokens, two runs each in order 0/4/8/12/12/8/4/0 MiB:

| Attention prefetch | Code tok/s | Prose tok/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Off | 28.860 | 22.725 |
| 4 MiB | 29.160 | 22.890 |
| 8 MiB | 29.205 | 22.870 |
| 12 MiB | 29.090 | 22.800 |

Selected **4 MiB**, the smallest favorable tested budget: approximately
**+1.0% code / +0.7% prose** in this short screen. Variance is comparable to
some of the code gain; this is not evidence of a large general speedup.
Every fixed-length output was identical. Pacing at 150 GB/s lost the short
communication-window microbenchmark (4 MiB: 33.6 us versus unpaced bulk
20.5 and touch 25.0); it remains disabled. The original communication site
remains touch/2 MiB.

**Memory:** an isolated CUDA GEMM probe exposed **32 MiB retained per new
warm-up stream** by cuBLAS; repeatedly using the same stream added zero.
`FastDecoder` now reuses one warm-up stream across captures. In the final
full-engine screen, allocated memory after each of eight two-parity warmups
was exactly **100,771,292,672 bytes**. The initial test's first-to-last warmup
allocated growth was **448 MiB** across the same number of captures. This
fixes a verified growth mechanism, not a proven explanation of the entire
previous 55k-context OOM.

A graph-key cap alone was insufficient because draft graphs keep the shared
pool alive. At eight variants (configurable; 0 disables the cap), synchronize
and release verify graphs, memos, draft graphs and their pool together, then
recapture. The final forced two-entry-cache test alternated depths 3/5/3:
identical 96-token outputs across widths and both ranks, at most two entries,
and successful pool rotation. The new width's small static buffers remain;
returning to width 3 no longer creates a new 32 MiB stream workspace.

**Prefill:** both ranks agree on a conservative chunk budget before read-ahead
starts; current maximum remains 512, minimum 256, soft reserve 4 GiB. On the
11,063-token prompt, 512 versus forced-256 rows gave peak allocated memory
**101,557,899,264 versus 101,414,183,936 bytes** (137.06 MiB lower), at
**12.975 versus 18.049 s prefill**. The complete normal answer was identical;
forced post-EOS continuation differed, consistent with the documented
long-context index-tie limitation. This is a small bounded memory/answer
check, not a 55k or 200k+ context qualification. No context limit was reduced.
Images retain indivisible spans; oversized spans are reported. The scratch
estimate is not an OOM guarantee; the 2.5 GB watchdog is unchanged.

**Depth costs:** added opt-in `DSV41_CONF_COST_REFRESH` to replace stale
confidence-policy costs using three non-capture measurements of an unselected
width. Probe selection is independent of draft tokens, preserving the sampled
prefix stopping rule. CPU tests cover stale-cost recovery, capture exclusion,
disabled mode and pinned modes. It remains **off**, as does confidence depth;
normal serving retains the previously qualified automatic 3/5 policy.

Validation: **28 CPU tests**, exact synthetic/real-weight router checks, and
**29 final TP2 requests with matching rank hashes**, plus the initial speed
screen. Artifacts: `results/tensorfold-port-20261007/`, especially
`summary.json`, `router-micro.json`, `workspace-probe.json`, and
`v5/gate-rank{0,1}.json`. Live restoration uses image
`deepseek-v41-flash-spark:router-memory-v1`, with 9,574 residents, native
attention, abliteration enabled, prefix reuse and TTS preserved.

Live verification after restart: both nodes run the same image; head health
passes, native attention/abliteration/dynamic 9,574 residents are confirmed,
and TTS remains running. Exact `READY` and Japanese `はい` requests passed;
repeating the Japanese request reused **18/18 prefix tokens**. Health exposes
the selected prefill policy, attention prefetch budget and graph-memory counters.

### 2026-10-07 — Matched live HTTP prose, HTML and code: ours vs TensorFold

The user requested our existing benchmark on both engines. Reused
`bench/bench.py::WORKLOADS` and `run_once`: coastal-ecosystem prose, the Angry Birds
single-file HTML game, and the Python LRU/TTL module. One sequential stream,
512 output tokens, greedy temperature 0, top_p 0.95, seed 42, thinking false,
ignore_eos true; one warmup then two measured requests per workload, in that
order on each engine. All 18 requests completed with exactly 512 output tokens,
finish=length and no reasoning text. Request text/hash and generation settings
match across engines. Client decode rate is `(completion_tokens - 1) /
(total_s - first_content_time)`, using usage tokens, not SSE chunk count.

| Workload | Ours runs (tok/s) | TensorFold runs (tok/s) | Ours median | TF median | TF / ours |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prose | 20.496, 19.527 | 42.625, 43.040 | 20.011 | 42.833 | 2.14x |
| Angry Birds HTML | 37.841, 39.373 | 85.771, 85.475 | 38.607 | 85.623 | 2.22x |
| Python LRU/TTL code | 29.337, 29.413 | 60.824, 62.892 | 29.375 | 61.858 | 2.11x |

Our live image was `deepseek-v41-flash-spark:router-memory-v1` (the optimizations
above), dynamic TP2 with 9,574 residents, native attention, abliteration ON,
normal expert adaptation and urgent loads, depth 3/5, context 524,288. TensorFold
used the already installed `dsv41-tensorfold:local-overlay` image (sha256
`da0556529150d39598102b5acb95c7cc3520c023d7585a3e9de77341481d5444`), its existing
EXL3 2.9 bpw pack and prepared caches, saved local full-prefill profile, expert
pruning OFF, fp32 mHC mixing/logits, overlay OFF, 196,608 context and four slots
(one active). Its source pack itself is labelled uncensored. No model download,
repack or image rebuild. TTS was already stopped before the comparison and was
left stopped for both engines. This is a comparison of the saved usable engine
profiles, not equal weights, equal numerics, equal resident coverage or equal
memory allocations, and not a reproduction of TensorFold's README speed preset.

The gap is not explained by TensorFold accepting more tokens per round. Measured
output tokens per verification window (ours / TensorFold) were prose
1.91–1.99 / 1.646–1.684, HTML 4.62–4.66 / 4.531, and code 3.00–3.07 / 2.96–3.03.
Dividing these by client decode throughput implies about 97–98 / 39 ms per prose
round, 117–123 / 53 ms per HTML round, and 102–105 / 48–49 ms per code round.
These are effective wall-time estimates, including host/adaptation/drafting;
they are NOT direct GPU verification-kernel timings, nor matched verify row
counts. They justify profiling round cost before attributing the gap to draft
acceptance. Weight formats, attention precision, selected widths and execution
paths still differ; bit-width scaling alone does not establish an attainable
native-weight target.

Median TTFT (ours / TensorFold): prose 1,185 / 297 ms; HTML 269 / 310 ms; code
803 / 331 ms. Our measured HTML requests reused all 62 prompt tokens; TF reported
zero cached tokens. Prose/code reported zero reused prompt tokens on both. Thus
HTML TTFT is not a cold-prefill comparison. These short prompts do not measure
bulk prefill throughput. All answers are token-capped; outputs are saved for
inspection but these timings establish neither complete-game/code correctness
nor quality parity. Two measured runs provide a small screen, not a confidence
interval or a sustained-load qualification.

Operational note: TF initially reached the API in 50 seconds, but its first
strict canary hit the memory-admission timeout while startup file caches occupied
RAM. The launcher stopped the pair. The retry reclaimed clean host file caches
on both nodes immediately at API readiness; all five strict canaries passed.
Memory floors and saved model settings were unchanged. Both attempts are retained
in the artifacts. Our service was restored after the comparison.

Artifacts: `results/engine-comparison-20261007/`: `run.py`, `summary.json`,
`manifest.json`, per-engine per-request outputs/stats, TF raw SSE streams and
rank logs, and startup/restoration logs. The ignored configuration snapshot is
mode 0600. Exact prompts are in each request JSON; comparison checks all nine
prompt hashes against one another. No benchmark answer is fed into a later
request.

### 2026-10-07 — GPU breakdown against TensorFold, four verification rows

The user authorized using the pair for profiling. Both serving engines were
already stopped after the user's TF launcher hit its 104 GiB pre-load gate
(head had 103 GiB free). Reclaimed clean file caches, then ran disposable TP2
profiles; finally started TensorFold in the unchanged saved serving profile
(196,608 context, four slots, model `deepseek`, port 8000). Its five startup
canaries passed; `/health` reported TensorFold OK, idle, zero errors.

Diagnostic workload: the same `[req 70101]` Python LRU/TTL benchmark prompt (62
rendered tokens), greedy, 160 output tokens, no EOS stopping. Both used a 32,768
context allocation, fixed draft depth 3 / four verify rows. Our 9,574-resident
map was frozen (snapshot of the learned database, no persistence or adaptation);
TensorFold used one request slot and a 32,768-token pool. Native attention and
abliteration stayed on in ours; TF retained the saved EXL3/full-prefill/no-pruning/
FP32-mixing profile, overlay off. This aligns verification width, not weights,
precision, output trajectories, expert selections or profiling positions.

Used PyTorch/CUPTI kernel traces, without per-operator synchronization. Our
existing timeline driver captures 12 middle decode rounds (output tokens 67–102)
on both ranks after two full warm runs. TF captures one 160-token request after
two warm runs. Its four-row main graph has 1,113 distinct kernel nodes, each
replayed 62 times; a single shorter final window is excluded. Our six main
segment/parity graphs have complete 5/7-replay node sets, totaling 12 forwards.
Both profiled outputs matched their own warm outputs; ours matched on both ranks.
This does not mean outputs match *between engines*.

| Rank-0 GPU measurement, ms | Ours | TensorFold |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Main verification graph span per four-row forward | 80.62 | 41.80 |
| Expert matrix kernels (routed + shared), summed per forward | 44.55 | 22.19 |
| Dense projection kernels including BF16 matmuls/head in ours | 21.75 | 9.56 |
| Communication kernels inside main graphs | 4.10 | 1.84 |
| Draft graph span per pass | 10.40 | 3.72 |

Main span is the first kernel start to last kernel end for each graph replay;
ours sums its sequential graph segments per forward. Component rows are summed
kernel durations; kernels on different streams overlap, so **do not add these
rows or interpret their differences as independent recoverable savings**.
Correction: the first kernel-name grouping counted our shared experts as dense,
while TF's x3ld class included them as experts. Their 7.27 ms up + 2.98 ms down
are now assigned to experts on both sides. Our dense row is
`_fp8_linear_kernel` + `_fp8_grouped_kernel` (28.47 ms), minus those 10.26 ms,
plus BF16 WMMA matmuls (3.54 ms). The apparent 3.35x dense gap was therefore
misclassified; the corrected kernel-sum ratio is 2.27x. Shared expert work
overlaps routed work, so the corrected expert sum is not critical-path latency.
`reclassify_shared.py` verifies 480 up and 480 down calls (40 layers, 12 rounds),
using the shared-down/routed-down overlap to distinguish wo_b's identical grid.
The original `breakdown.json` is retained as the raw-family audit;
`corrected-grouping.json` records this correction.
TF's row is EXL3 `dense3::lanes_linear_kernel` and
`linear_kernel` projections (9.56 ms). Our other main FP32 matmuls total 11.37 ms
(router/mHC and other small GEMMs); TF's fused mHC boundary alone is 4.04 ms, but
these scopes are not identical and should not be called a matched mHC speedup.
TF paced prefetch kernels sum to 10.25 ms, substantially overlapped; they are
not an additional 10.25 ms of wall latency.

Our draft graph includes 4.51 ms of BF16 matmuls and 2.52 ms of FP8 projections
per pass. TF's EXL3 dense projections consume 1.68 ms per draft pass. This makes
dense attention/head/draft math a stronger profiling target than another small
router-tail or prefetch tweak. Much of the comparison is a format/precision
tradeoff (TF quantizes attention/head too), not yet a demonstrated implementation
inefficiency or permission to reduce native precision. No DRAM counters were
collected; this cannot establish achieved memory bandwidth or a guaranteed 1.5x
native-weight speedup.

Our 12-round rank-0 capture covers 1,154.01 ms, with GPU-activity interval union
1,087.75 ms and 66.26 ms idle (5.74%); rank 1 idle 54.55/1,152.86 ms (4.73%).
The Engram future-wait spans overlapped only 0.044 ms of rank-0 GPU idle in this
capture. Earlier host `engram`/`decode_engram_wait` counters include GPU waits
and can overlap; their percentages cannot establish an SSD bottleneck. Ours'
last unprofiled run was 5.454 s decode for 160 tokens. TF's unprofiled client
rate was 54.71 tok/s and profiled rate 53.45 tok/s at this fixed depth. These
short diagnostic numbers are not replacements for the preceding live 512-token
workload comparison.

Profiler pitfalls retained: first Nsight run suppressed most TF CUDA graphs
because its extra memory pushed below the capture floor, so those measurements
were rejected. CUDA-profiler API triggering produced no report. NVTX triggering
produced a host-only report; its SQLite diagnostics showed insufficient CUPTI
privileges, and even a small SYS_ADMIN probe yielded runtime events but no
kernel events (incomplete hardware tracing). A PyTorch CUDA profiler probe
successfully recorded real GPU kernels, so both accepted profiles use that.
With Nsight removed, TF held its normal main/draft graphs and replayed them.
No graph memory guard was lowered. Failed/rejected traces and logs are retained.

Artifacts: `results/round-breakdown-20261007/`: `breakdown.json`, `analyze.py`,
`tensorfold/trace.json` and `report.json`, `ours/rank0.json`, both rank summaries,
launchers/logs, frozen learned-map copy, failed Nsight runs and tiny probes,
and `restored-tf-health.json`. Driver: `tools/bench_round_breakdown_tp.py`.
No serving engine implementation was changed by that profiling measurement.

### October 7: decode candidates screened; no new default adopted

Native FP8 scheduling/bit-scale microbenchmarks are retained under
`results/dense-decode-opt-20261007/`. A 14% wo_b win in the initial sweep shrank
to **103.4 -> 99.9 us** in the controlled four-row test; fused qkv was
47.3 -> 45.6 us and wq_b did not improve. Exhaustive finite-BF16 activation
checks, all 256 scale codes, and 120 real-layer/shape/row checks passed exactness
and row invariance. `DSV41_FP8_DECODE_PIPELINE=0` remains the default; a full-model
campaign for this marginal candidate was skipped. Ordered split-K and one-time
QDQ negatives are recorded in `docs/gotchas.md`.

The larger draft-work prototype combines native TP attention for the three
DSpark blocks and scoring Markov biases only over 128 base-logit candidates.
The target's weights and verification remain unchanged. Shortlisting is an
approximate **proposal** change and applies only to greedy, non-tree drafting;
sampled drafting retains its full-vocabulary Markov calculation. Both new
settings are checked in the boot-time pair guard and default off:
`DSV41_TP_DRAFT_ATTN=0`, `DSV41_DRAFT_MARKOV_TOPK=0`.

The actual Markov weights with synthetic five-row logits measured **1.933 ms
full vs 0.114 ms shortlist**, about 17x for that component. Graph and eager
outputs agreed within each path. This is a latency screen, not an acceptance
or quality result. The frozen-map TP2 test then used native attention,
abliteration on, 9,574 residents, context 32K, fixed draft depth 3, temperature
zero, and the prose/code `[req 70101]` prompts, 192 generated tokens each:

| Arm | Prose tok/s | Code tok/s | Prose accepted block | Code accepted block |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Initial baseline (earlier process) | 22.57 | 31.78 | 1.97 | 2.77 |
| TP draft attention + shortlist 128 | 20.65 | 29.83 | 1.89 | 2.73 |
| Following baseline (same process as candidate) | 20.48 | 29.54 | 1.97 | 2.77 |

All completed candidate/baseline output hashes matched across arms and ranks,
including 64-token warmups; the expert map stayed fixed. The same-process
~1% throughput difference is not a demonstrated useful gain, particularly
given the larger baseline variation across processes. Faster draft work lost
acceptance; no new option was enabled in the live preset. No broader benchmark
suite was run. The initial combined attempt ended before candidate output;
graph-unsafe scalar candidate indexing was replaced with device gather and
checked in the standalone graph screen. A retry exposed a diagnostic resume
path bug on rank 1; the driver now checks each rank's own baseline file before
loading the model. Failure artifacts are retained alongside the successful
`draft-tp-final/` run. The isolated TensorFold dense sweep was stopped following
the user's request to limit benchmarking; it has no usable result.

Checkpoint-header accounting also explains why a pack's headline 2.9 bpw is
misleading here. Core attention projections plus the vocabulary head contain
**3.380 GB/rank native vs 1.947 GB/rank EXL3 packed weights**, a 1.736x byte
ratio before implementation differences. This is a one-read payload model,
not measured DRAM traffic; it excludes auxiliaries/experts/KV and small EXL3
scale tables. Attention is predominantly 5-bit in the EXL3 pack (layer-0
wq_a/wkv are 6-bit), and its head is 6-bit versus our BF16. The audit is in
`core-weight-bytes.json` and `tf-dense-formats.json`. Neither these bytes nor
overlapping kernel-duration sums establish a recoverable 3x native speedup.

## October 7: staged decode attention (experimental, default off)

`DSV41_ATTN_STAGED=1` replaces the decode attention core's two FP32 SIMT
matmuls with tensor-core QK and TF32x3 PV, retaining the existing full-matrix
FP32 softmax. `=2` additionally stages the BF16-valued keys directly in BF16
scratch. Native FP8 projection weights, expert allocation, and prefill are
unchanged. Both ranks guard the mode at boot. The default remains `0` because
accumulation changes and this was a small quality screen.

The isolated graph screen (GB10, T=4, H=32, D=512, synthetic BF16-valued Q/K)
measured 37.53 -> 12.93 us at 128 keys and 59.42 -> 28.72 us at 640 keys for
the two GEMMs plus softmax. Relative error against FP64 was below 8e-7 in
those cases; about 0.05% of final BF16 elements differed from the existing
core. This is a hot repeated graph microbenchmark, not full-layer latency.
Keeping key scratch in BF16 then reduced gather-plus-staged-core latency
from 73.50 to 47.69 us at 1152 keys, and 321.66 to 157.68 us at 3200 keys.
The scratch key bits were identical after widening (including signed zeros),
but BF16 input typing changed the compiler's PV lowering slightly.

Two bounded TP2 A/B/A runs kept the expert map frozen (9574 residents), native
FP8 attention, ablit on, depth 3, temperature 0, seed 42, thinking off, and
192 forced output tokens. Prompt prefix was `[req 70101]` for prose and code.
Mode 2's surrounding baselines and candidate were:

| Workload | Baseline before / after, tok/s | Staged BF16 keys, tok/s | Change vs baseline mean |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prose | 21.14 / 21.15 | 23.76 | +12.4% |
| Code | 29.41 / 29.71 | 30.80 | +4.2% |

**These are different generated token sequences**, not a controlled same-output
speedup: acceptance changed from 1.97 to 2.17 on prose and 2.77 to 2.92 on code.
Repeat baseline hashes matched. The depth policy's final smoothed step estimates
were 88.7 vs 91.05 ms and 90.1 vs 92.05 ms, but total decode wall time divided
by steps was 91.33 vs 92.17 ms and 93.97 vs 93.64 ms respectively. Therefore
the throughput gains do not establish a large pure execution-time improvement.
Mode 1 had measured +10.6% prose and +0.8% code under its own A/B/A.

Both ranks agreed on every output. Eight-deep JSON, exact mixed-language copying,
and arithmetic JSON passed 3/3 in both arms of each run with identical answers.
These three objective checks do not establish general quality parity; no
default or live `.env` was changed. TensorFold was restored after the tests.

Rejected micro-only variants are retained: direct packed-key tile loads were
236.07 us at T=4/N=1152, versus 47.69 us for BF16 staging; repeated unpacking
was more expensive than staging. Four-way PV splitting did not help the long
case. Three BF16 probability components offered no gain and worse FP64 error.
No full-model test was spent on those variants.

Drivers: `tools/bench_decode_attn_staged.py`, `tools/bench_attention_direct.py`,
`tools/bench_attention_staged_tp.py`. Raw outputs, source snapshots, summaries,
and rejected screens: `results/attention-core-opt-20261007/`.

## October 7: exact verification widths and router/expert follow-up

The next decode screen adds opt-in `DSV41_VERIFY_ODD=1`: the target can verify
one through six rows, allowing draft depths 0/2/4 as well as 1/3/5. Confidence
selection can use depths 1–5; its sampled prefix stopping rule still makes
decisions without looking ahead into unproposed tokens. The default is `0`.
The trained DSpark drafter retains its five-row shape for dynamic depth grids.
Both ranks guard the new mode at boot.

Qualification caught two real correctness issues. Odd widths need compressor
pending state based on end parity, and native batch-one QK/PV accumulation
differs from a wider batch. Broadcasting the one-row attention product to two
rows before retaining row zero restored its native batched arithmetic. Cold
capture must also preserve pending values that alias static warm-up buffers.
The initial failed run is retained; its graph timings are invalid because the
driver had not refreshed embedding/pre-mix inputs before every timed replay.

The corrected TP2 check used native attention/router, ablit on, 9,574 frozen
residents, context 32K and graph cap 16. A 4,114/4,115-token prefix exercised
compressed-key selection above 1,024 entries. All 12 width/parity combinations
matched the six-row target's **full FP32 logits and hidden-state prefixes
bit-for-bit**, on both ranks. Actual eager/fast compressor rollback checks
passed 54 boundaries and native attention-product checks passed 24 cases.
Main-graph event medians (three replays with input/state refreshed outside
events) were 55–56 ms at width one, 64–65 at two, 72 at three, 81 at four,
87–90 at five and 93–95 at six. These exclude draft/host work and are not
end-to-end round latency.

The following short generation comparison kept the same map, native math,
temperature zero, seed 42, thinking off and `[req 70101]` prose/code prompts.
Each arm had a 32-token warm-up followed by 192 forced generated tokens:

| Workload / pinned draft depth | Decode tok/s | Decode wall ms/step | Mean accepted block |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prose / 3 | 20.09 | 97.01 | 1.97 |
| Prose / 2 | 20.42 | 88.23 | 1.82 |
| Code / 5 | 26.76 | 120.95 | 3.24 |
| Code / 4 | 29.18 | 103.89 | 3.03 |

Each pair emitted identical 192-token sequences, with rank agreement. Depth
two improved prose throughput only **1.6%**; depth four improved code **9.0%**
versus five. This was a single A/B, not A/B/A or a broad workload result.
Native depth three in the separate router control measured 29.11–29.58 tok/s
on code: the depth-four result is not a 9% improvement over the default depth
three. The useful change is finer choices for the cost/acceptance policy,
not a universal speedup or evidence that the deepest block is best.

All six widths at both parities exceed the default eight-graph pool capacity.
The qualification used 16; the default remains eight for memory safety.
An all-depth deployment must budget graph memory or accept pool recaptures.
Narrow depth grids can avoid that expansion. No live `.env` was changed.

The second candidate, `DSV41_ROUTER_BF16=1`, uses the router's original BF16
gate values with FP32 tensor-core accumulation and a split reduction. It
rejects gates whose FP32 values would narrow when copied into BF16; default
router math is unchanged. Cold gates from all 40 layers measured **60–61 ->
19–20 us** at rows 1/4/6. In 9,600 synthetic row/mask/scale routing cases,
selected sets/order stayed identical and routed-weight deltas were below
1.8e-7. This is a component screen, not a serving quality result.

The same-loaded-model A/B/A used fixed depth three and the same 192-token
workloads. Graphs were released between arms; both ranks and the expert map
agreed throughout:

| Workload | Native before / after, tok/s | BF16 router, tok/s | Native before / after, wall ms/step | BF16 router, wall ms/step |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prose | 19.83 / 20.56 | 21.66 | 98.30 / 94.78 | 91.83 |
| Code | 29.11 / 29.58 | 29.46 | 95.10 / 93.58 | 95.35 |

Baseline output hashes repeated exactly; BF16 router hashes changed on both
workloads. Prose wall time per step was about 3.1% lower than the following
baseline; code did not improve. The baseline drift and changed acceptance
preclude calling the component's 3x speedup a general engine gain. Eight-deep
JSON, verbatim Japanese/accented copying and arithmetic JSON passed 3/3 with
identical answers in both arms. They are only a quality floor; their timings
are not throughput measurements. The router option stays **off** and adds
150 MiB/rank when enabled.

Removed unused `FastDecoder` BF16 main/draft gate copies: **153.75 MiB saved
per rank by default**, with no changed production arithmetic. The optional
router prepares its own main-gate copies outside graph capture. Timing-policy
guards now use cumulative capture counts, so a full graph-pool replacement
cannot masquerade as a warm step when the number of cached graphs is unchanged.

Finally, `FP4_V2_PAIR_BATCH=2` interleaves two expert reduction chains while
preserving their order. Eighty-four bit checks passed, including intermediate
partials, final BF16/FP32 output and mixed absent/null experts. Favorable
low-union cells improved 4–11%, but rows4/U14 slowed 609.3 -> 620.0 us and
rows6/U20 slowed 866.4 -> 884.3 us. More shared memory makes the gain
workload-dependent; the compile default remains one. No full-model campaign
was spent on this mixed microbenchmark result.

Artifacts: `results/decode-followup-20261007/`, successful TP2 files in
`tp-v2/` from both ranks, rejected initial run in `tp/`, and compact
`summary.json`; expert screen in `results/fp4-pairbatch-20261007/`.
Drivers: `tools/bench_verify_odd_tp.py`, `tools/bench_verify_depths_tp.py`,
`tools/bench_router_bf16.py`, `tools/bench_router_followup_tp.py`,
`tools/bench_bmm_rows.py`, `tools/bench_fp4_pairbatch.py`.
TensorFold was restored afterward; all five startup canaries passed and
`restored-tf-health.json` reports idle, healthy, zero errors.

## October 7: lossless BF16 head rewrite and bounded TP2 qualification

The user authorized rewriting head kernels or other inefficient engine logic.
TensorFold was stopped and remains off. The new opt-in
`DSV41_HEAD_KERNEL=packed` keeps every BF16 checkpoint bit while storing
sign/mantissa bytes, four-bit exponent deltas per128 weights, and full-exponent
escape groups. K-group-major tiles plus explicit Gluon native MMA kWidth2
reduce the actual local TP2 shard **661,913,600 -> 508,819,072 bytes**, saving
**146.00 MiB per rank**. Only 15,949 of 2,585,600 groups needed escape storage.
Serving keeps no duplicate native GPU head.

Cold actual-weight microbenchmark, N64640/K5120, widths1–6, four seeded BF16
activation cases (scales0.1/1/4), six balanced quartets:

| Rows | Production head, ms | Packed Gluon BN32, ms |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 3.078 | 2.251 |
| 2 | 2.951 | 2.252 |
| 3 | 2.953 | 2.273 |
| 4 | 2.945 | 2.262 |
| 5 | 2.951 | 2.262 |
| 6 | 2.975 | 2.277 |

Every checked logit, row prefix and graph replay matched, totaling
**5,429,760 checked logits**. All stored weight bits matched. The prefill
fallback at M17/32/128/512, two scales, matched **89,073,920 logits** against
the guarded native cuBLAS result. These finite checks are not a proof for
every possible activation. Nine focused regression tests passed, including
the raw FP32 cancellation example, masks, graph replay, ownership, config
rejection and consumer dispatch. The default remains off in `.env.example`.

A same-loaded-model **native / packed / packed / native** full-engine gate
used two nodes, native attention, abliteration on, fixed speculative depth3,
temperature0, seed42, maxcontext65,536 and a frozen 9,574-resident learned
expert map. Each arm had one64-token code warmup, then160 tokens each of the
existing `[req41420]` code and prose prompts. Graphs were released between
arms; no learned history or prefix cache was written or reused.

| Workload | Native tok/s (two arms) | Packed tok/s (two arms) | Native / packed mean wall ms/round | Accepted block, both |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Code | 29.25 / 29.71 | 29.66 / 30.49 | 91.43 / 89.62 | 2.71 |
| Prose | 21.02 / 21.24 | 21.45 / 21.69 | 89.57 / 87.76 | 1.93 |

Mean round throughput improved **2.02% code / 2.07% prose**. Tokens, step
counts, acceptance, expert map and both rank outputs matched in all12 runs.
Sixteen eager actual-activation head checks per rank were also bit-identical.
Use these short results with their baseline drift; the head's30–37% component
gain does not imply a similar engine gain or close the TensorFold speed gap.
The first packed code prefill included JIT and took1.083s; the following warm
one took0.419s versus native0.417–0.418s. Prefill throughput was not a target.

Rejected prototypes are retained: direct native TC only saved~2% of head time;
SIMT changed outputs; row-major byte-packed projection was slower; tiled
byte-derived dot changed arithmetic. See the cancellation negative in
`docs/gotchas.md`. The winner reads its packed bytes at roughly223GB/s,
close to the unpacked kernel's measured bandwidth, so further tiny tile
tuning was skipped.

Artifacts: `results/head-native-20261008/` (native/packed screens and prefill
fallback), `results/head-packed-asm-20261007/` (compiler arithmetic audit and
width qualification), `results/head-packed-integration-20261008/` (both rank
reports, ABBA summary and immutable source snapshot). Driver:
`tools/bench_native_head_tp.py`. No additional quantization was introduced.

### 2026-10-07 — Native MoE byte floor and low-U rewrite scope

Read-only audit; no additional GPU/model/service benchmark was run. The
corrected four-row profile contains **34.30 ms native routed FP4** and
**10.26 ms FP8 shared-expert** kernel sums, with overlapping work. Thus the
44.55 vs TensorFold 22.19 ms comparison does not establish a recoverable 2x
native-kernel gain.

The existing cold real layer-0 TP-output microbenchmark has 9,400,320 bytes
per expert per rank, counting native FP4 codes and UE8M0 scales. Derived
minimum-payload throughput is `U * 9,400,320 / (up_us + down_us) / 1000`:
T4/U14 **609.3 us, 216.0 GB/s**; T4/U20 **852.6 us, 220.5 GB/s**;
T6/U20 **866.4 us, 217.0 GB/s**. These are payload/time estimates, not DRAM
counters. The deployed v2 already reads every weight row once per expert
block and reuses its registers across members.

Repeated-expert cells have more room: T4/U6 **437.3 us, 129.0 GB/s** and
T6/U6 **573.7 us, 98.3 GB/s**. Reading six native experts at a reference
223 GB/s takes 252.9 us, giving illustrative component ceilings of 1.73x
and 2.27x. These are neither measured TC gains nor engine throughput claims.
A generic full-K tensor-core dot changes the current arithmetic; an exact
sparse-virtual-row group prototype must prove the existing even/odd FMA tree,
FP16 activation conversion and four scaled ordered chains before timing.
Existing `DOT_SCALED` results do not measure these cold TP-output low-U cells.

CPU-only actual-code histograms over nine matrices (expert zero at layers
0/20/39, w1/w2/w3) measured zero-order entropy **3.884–3.896 bits** including
signed zero, leaving only 2.6–2.9% ideal code-byte saving before overhead.
This rules out assuming BF16-head-like savings from simple symbol coding;
it is not a bound on more elaborate conditional compression.

Artifacts: existing `results/fp4-pairbatch-20261007/screen.json` and corrected
`results/round-breakdown-20261007/corrected-grouping.json`; new CPU histogram
`results/fp4-pairbatch-20261007/symbol-entropy.json`, reproducible with
`tools/inspect_fp4_entropy.py`. No new runtime default or numerical policy
was selected.

### 2026-10-07 — Sparse native FP4 tensor-core proof and rejected helper cost

Benchmark-only prototype `tools/fp4_group_tc.py` preserves native packed E2M1
codes and BF16-to-FP16 activation conversion, then explicitly reconstructs
the existing eight-leaf group reduction. Even/odd two-product MMAs changed
**854/7,488** mixed-logrange raw FP32 outputs. The minimal counterexample is
`1 + 1.5 * 2^-23`: CUDA RN-FMA gives `1 + 2^-22`, while the two-product MMA
gives `1 + 2^-23`. Uniform-code and simple boundary tests had missed this.

Four one-product MMAs plus explicit RN pair sums passed **35,776 finite raw
FP32 comparisons**, including every finite-converted BF16 code, all 16 FP4
codes, all 256 byte patterns, subnormals, signed zero and cancellation. The
separate overflow report matched 32 output bit patterns on this GPU; no universal
NaN/hardware equivalence is claimed.

A captured hot component screen used 256 independent 32-K groups, N1152,
32 calls per graph and six balanced quartets:

| Members | Extracted native CUDA, us | Exact sparse MMA, us | Slowdown |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 8.063 | 109.108 | 13.53x |
| 2 | 15.220 | 108.539 | 7.13x |

This prices only the group helper and layout work, not cold actual MoE or
engine throughput. UE8M0 scales, four ordered full-K chains and the up/down
epilogues are excluded. The sparse padded-MMA spelling has no measured case
for a full-K extension, so the actual-weight/model campaign was skipped.
Relayout remains a possible future direction; no serving kernel/default
changed. The previously measured packed-head optimization remains separate.

Artifacts: `results/fp4-group-tc-20261007/proof.json` (two-product failure),
`single-products-proof.json` (passing raw gate and helper timing), qualified
source and PTX snapshots. Reproduce with
`tools/test_fp4_group_tc.py --single-products --timing --out <report.json>`;
`tools/bench_fp4_sparse_tc.py` retains a gated cold driver for future qualified
full-K candidates, but it was not run for this rejected prototype.

### 2026-10-08 — Three existing arithmetic switches: −7.3 ms/step, acceptance unchanged over 22 prompts

Before this, `DSV41_HC_KERNEL`, `DSV41_ATTN_STAGED` and `DSV41_ROUTER_BF16` were each turned
down after a single-prompt A/B in which acceptance moved. Rounding changes reshuffle greedy
near-ties, so one prompt's acceptance length moves in a random direction. This run measures
step time and acceptance separately, paired over many prompts.

**Per-operation cost (CUPTI, one loaded TP2 process).** Frozen 9,574-resident map, fixed depth 3,
code prompt, 8 profiled rounds per configuration, graphs released between configurations, both
ranks switched identically. Critical-path ms per four-row verify forward, attention blocks L1–39:

| | base | base repeat | staged2 | router (BF16 + tail) | hc | all |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| attention core | 5.31 | 5.15 | 1.99 | 5.11 | 5.05 | 2.08 |
| router | 3.18 | 3.26 | 3.11 | 1.53 | 3.21 | 1.53 |
| mHC (incl. split-K kernel) | 8.93 | 8.86 | 8.70 | 9.00 | 6.96 | 6.69 |
| attention blocks | 39.81 | 40.97 | 36.16 | 37.85 | 38.58 | 33.23 |
| L0 up → L39 down | 73.85 | 76.06 | 70.44 | 72.28 | 72.79 | 67.60 |

The two baseline runs emitted identical tokens and still differ by 3.1 ms of MoE time, so
whole-forward spans carry about ±2 ms of run-to-run noise. The component rows are stable.

**Throughput and acceptance (paired, 24 prompts).** Same frozen map and depth. Prompts cover
code, prose, math, JSON/YAML, Japanese, French and HTML. Each prompt ran greedy to EOS or 160
tokens in both arms, with arm order alternating per prompt. Two prompts finished in fewer than
8 steps and were excluded. Ranks agreed on every output; 4 of 24 outputs were identical.

| | base | all | paired Δ ± SE (n = 22) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ms per decode step | 88.91 | 81.61 | −7.30 ± 0.50 |
| mean accepted length | 2.711 | 2.714 | +0.003 ± 0.026 |
| decode tok/s | 30.25 | 32.97 | +2.72 ± 0.35 (+9.0%) |

Per-prompt acceptance moved both ways, by up to ±0.3, and averaged to zero. No output in either
arm repeated any 8-gram. The math, JSON and YAML answers are equivalent. The Japanese answer
contains U+FFFD in both arms, so it is not caused by these switches; it is unexamined (it may be
the driver's whole-sequence decode).

Caveats: "base" ran with `DSV41_ROUTER_FUSED_TAIL=0`, whereas serving uses 1 (a bit-exact
fusion). Its share of the difference is ≤0.2 ms/forward from the trace. `DSV41_ROUTER_BF16=1`
adds about 150 MiB per rank. This is a 160-token greedy screen on one image
(`api-pair-recovery-v1`). It does not establish long-context, sampled-decoding or tool-call
quality, and `engine/test_spec_lossless.py` was not run.

**Enabled in `.env` and `.env.example`** (`DSV41_ATTN_STAGED=2`, `DSV41_ROUTER_BF16=1`,
`DSV41_HC_KERNEL=1`; `.env.example` also moves to `DSV41_HEAD_KERNEL=packed`, which serving
already used). The live HTTP benchmark used the Oct 7 TensorFold-comparison driver unchanged
(`results/bench-switches-20261008/run.py`): 512 forced tokens, greedy, seed 42, one warmup and
two measured runs per workload. Serving used dynamic depth and live adaptation, image
`api-pair-recovery-v1`, and each arm ran right after a pair restart:

| Workload | tok/s before → after | ms/step before → after | accepted before → after | TF / ours |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prose | 21.93 → 23.09 (+5.3%) | 86.1 → 80.3 | 1.92 → 1.88 | 2.14x → 1.86x |
| Angry Birds HTML | 43.30 → 50.26 (+16.1%) | 104.7 → 91.9 | 4.63 → 4.79 | 2.22x → 1.70x |
| Python code | 32.26 → 37.37 (+15.8%) | 93.3 → 90.5 | 3.06 → 3.46 | 2.11x → 1.66x |

The TensorFold column uses its Oct 7 numbers; TF was not re-run. Step time improved on every
workload, most on HTML, where dynamic depth picks wider verify blocks. The extra HTML and code
gain is acceptance on these particular trajectories (outputs differ between arms). Plan on the
paired +9%. The base code runs alone ranged 86.9–99.7 ms/step. No post-change base re-run was
made, so adaptation drift between the arms is not excluded.

Same session: `DSV41_ENGRAM_PINNED=1` re-measured with no gain (see `docs/gotchas.md`).

Artifacts: `results/attn-block-20261008/` (per-config traces, both ranks),
`results/accept-ab-20261008/base-vs-all/` (per-prompt rows with text),
`results/engram-pinned-20261008/`. Drivers: `tools/bench_attn_block_tp.py`,
`tools/bench_accept_ab_tp.py`, `tools/bench_engram_pinned_tp.py`.

### 2026-10-08 — Draft pass: FP8 draft head + split Markov chain (+2.3%); L2 prefetch and shortlists rejected

Same method as above: one loaded TP2 process, frozen map, fixed depth 3, 24 prompts, paired.
Draft-only changes leave the target output untouched, so every arm below produced identical
tokens on all 24 prompts and both ranks. The acceptance deltas measure proposal quality alone.

| Draft change | ms/step Δ ± SE | accepted Δ ± SE | tok/s Δ ± SE |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Global top-128 Markov shortlist (`DRAFT_MARKOV_TOPK=128`) | −0.33 ± 0.56 | −0.101 ± 0.027 | −1.19 ± 0.36 |
| Per-rank top-256 candidates (`DRAFT_MARKOV_LOCAL=1`, K=512) | −1.79 ± 0.43 | −0.044 ± 0.014 | +0.22 ± 0.30 |
| **FP8 draft-only shard + split Markov chain** (deployed) | **−1.79 ± 0.43** | **+0.004 ± 0.005** | **+0.81 ± 0.21** |

Baselines: 81.18 ms/step for the shortlist row and 77.81 for the deployed row. The deployed row
ran on `draft-l2pf-v1`, which is `api-pair-recovery-v1` plus this session's engine files; the
first two ran from a source snapshot. The FP8 draft shard is +331,280,000 bytes per rank. It is
built from the BF16 vocabulary shard before packing; the verifier keeps the packed BF16 head. The
split chain gives each rank its 64,640 vocabulary rows of the Markov head and exchanges one
(max, global id) pair per position instead of 2.6 MB of logits. A two-rank CPU simulation matched
the full-vocabulary chain token for token. The first shortlist run had a post-switch warmup
artifact (~1.9 ms/step on the run after each switch), which alternating arm order cancels; the
driver now warms up on the measured prompt.

Draft pass traced with the FP8 draft head: 8.72 ms full Markov, 6.48 ms with per-rank candidates
(K=128). The FP8 head kernel takes ~230 µs per call, so it is not bandwidth-bound yet.

**L2 prefetch (rejected, switches default 0).** Cold FP8 projections are latency-bound on GB10:
wq_b 166 µs cold vs 46 µs L2-warm. New prefetch sites for this layer's wq_a+wkv / wq_b
(`DSV41_L2PF_QKV_MB`) and the shared expert (`DSV41_L2PF_SH_MB`) cut dense time by up to
3.1 ms per forward. None improved the forward: 66.4 / 68.3 ms off (two runs), 69.4–73.1 ms
`touch`, 70.6 ms `touchn`, 66.8–67.9 ms `bulk`. Details in `docs/gotchas.md`.

**Deployed live benchmark** (driver `results/bench-switches-20261008/run.py`, 512 forced tokens,
greedy, median of two; TensorFold from Oct 7):

| Workload | Before | Switches | + Draft | TF / ours |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prose | 21.93 | 23.09 | 25.43 | 1.68x |
| Angry Birds HTML | 43.30 | 50.26 | 52.68 | 1.63x |
| Python code | 32.26 | 37.37 | 38.38 | 1.61x |

ms/step before → deployed: 86.1 → 75.6, 104.7 → 85.5, 93.3 → 80.9. Accepted length 1.92 → 1.95,
4.63 → 4.72, 3.06 → 3.18. Paired estimates predict about +11–12%. The extra live gain includes
acceptance on these particular trajectories and drift between restarts.

Not run: `engine/test_spec_lossless.py`, which builds a single-node engine and would not exercise
the TP2 draft paths; the 24/24 identical outputs cover draft-only changes. Sampled decoding still
uses the full Markov path with the FP8 draft head; its acceptance was not measured.

### 2026-10-08 — TP draft attention, exact FP8 decode schedule, RMSNorm/HC launch fusions

Same paired method: one loaded TP2 process per A/B, frozen map, fixed depth 3, 24 prompts.

| Change | Outputs identical | ms/step Δ ± SE | accepted Δ ± SE | tok/s Δ ± SE |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `DSV41_TP_DRAFT_ATTN=1` (two processes, paired by prompt) | 24/24 | −1.67 ± 0.33 | 0 (2.718 both) | +0.70 ± 0.14 (+2.1%) |
| FP8 decode `BLOCK_N=32`, `BLOCK_K=256` | 24/24 | −1.47 ± 0.56 | 0 | +0.63 ± 0.29 (+1.8%) |
| One-pass RMSNorm + HC mean(x²) in the split-K pass | 8/24 | −2.11 ± 0.63 | +0.023 ± 0.016 | +1.45 ± 0.42 (+4.0%) |

The `TP_DRAFT_ATTN` comparison crosses processes; repeating a prompt within one process moved
ms/step by 1.5 ms on average. Draft attention can only change proposals, and acceptance was
identical on every prompt.

FP8 schedule. Cold weights (12 rotating copies, 4 rows) under the current schedule:
`wq_a+wkv` 66 µs, `wq_b` 115, `wo_a` 99, `wo_b` 119, shared `w13` 74, shared `w2` 48. Under
`BLOCK_N=32`, `BLOCK_K=256`: 58 / 106 / 91 / 104 / 65 / 40 µs. Every swept tile, warp, stage and
K-tile combination produced bit-identical outputs. `tl.dot` chains the accumulator through the
same K steps whatever the tile, so a 256-wide K tile is not split-K. `BLOCK_K` is a new switch,
default 128.

Fusions (GB10, graph replay). RMSNorm 10.3 → 4.1 µs (q_norm, strided), 8.2 → 4.1 (kv_norm),
14.3 → 4.9 (D=5120). q/kv norm outputs were bit-identical in the screen; at D=5120, 0.005% of
elements differ. HC mixes 20.5 → 13.4 µs. The split-K projection is *not* bit-identical when fed
BF16 instead of the FP32 pad (the MMA lowering changes): pre/post/comb differ by ≤2.4e-7, with
error against FP64 matching the old path. No fused-arm output repeated an 8-gram; math, JSON and
YAML answers were equivalent.

**Live benchmark on `fused-v1`** (the same driver; `api-pair-recovery-v1` plus this session's
engine files; TTS not loaded):

| Workload | Start of session | Switches | + Draft | + Kernels | TF / ours (Oct 7 TF) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prose | 21.93 | 23.09 | 25.43 | 26.44 | 2.14x → 1.62x |
| Angry Birds HTML | 43.30 | 50.26 | 52.68 | 53.41 | 2.22x → 1.60x |
| Python code | 32.26 | 37.37 | 38.38 | 40.38 | 2.11x → 1.53x |

ms/step start → now: 86.1 → 72.4, 104.7 → 86.9, 93.3 → 77.2. Paired estimates sum to about
+19%; the live runs show +20–25%. Artifacts: `results/accept-ab-20261008/{tpattn-off,tpattn-on,
live-vs-fp8sched,fp8sched-vs-fused}/`, `results/bench-switches-20261008/fused/`.

## 2026-10-08 — Cold prefill: Engram reads were stalling the GPU

Disposable TP2 gate on `fused-v1`. Frozen map, no swaps, no prefix reuse. Fresh random-word 8K
prompts (bench/bench.py's workload, seeded), plus one 32K. `tools/bench_prefill_trace_tp.py`,
with `DSV41_PREFILL_TIMING=1` and `DSV41_ATTN_TIMING=1`. Live serving measured 390–470 tok/s on
the same kind of prompt before. TensorFold publishes 2,028–2,310.

Breakdown (baseline): GPU busy 95%, but in-kernel MoE stalls (above) put both ranks into the
all-gather. The same prompt with its Engram rows cached: 19.6 → 11.4 s. Root cause and fix in
docs/gotchas.md. `DSV41_ENGRAM_DIRECT=1` reads rows with `O_DIRECT`; the paired gate used the
same prompts and the same process layout:

| Prompt | Rows | Baseline s (tok/s) | Direct s (tok/s) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8K #1 | 512 | 16.53 (496) | 10.48 (782) |
| 8K #2 | 2048 | 18.61 (440) | 9.98 (820) |
| 8K #3 | 1024 | 22.88 (358) | 8.78 (933) |
| 8K #4 | 2048 | 15.04 (545) | 10.01 (818) |
| 8K #5 | 512 | 19.57 (418) | 10.05 (814) |
| 32K | 2048 | 61.84 (530) | 35.41 (925) |
| 8K traced | 512 | 15.81 (517) | 11.61 (705) |
| 8K traced | 2048 | 16.16 (507) | 8.91 (920) |

First tokens equal on every prompt. With direct reads at 2,048 rows, an 8K prefill is ~8.2 s of
compute: experts 2.2–2.9 s, elementwise copies 1.7 s, compressed-KV gather and indexing 1.0 s,
BF16 GEMMs 1.0 s, prefill attention 0.9 s. Collective waiting is 1.8 s, of which 0.27 s is
transfer. Not yet deployed or measured on decode. Artifacts: `results/prefill-trace-20261008/`

### Prefill kernels and serving (2026-10-08, continued)

Paired gate, `DSV41_ENGRAM_DIRECT=prefill`, 2,048 rows. Same process, the arms rotate per prompt:
3 random 8K prompts + 2 natural (~8K, repo docs).

| Arm | Mean prefill s | Per prompt |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| base | 9.48 | 8.66, 7.60, 7.57, 12.72, 10.85 |
| indexed attention (exact) | 7.55 | 6.72, 9.14, 7.07, 8.14, 6.70 |
| HC front fused | 7.58 | 7.14, 7.28, 7.29, 8.80, 7.38 |
| indexer fused | 7.71 | 7.33, 7.34, 7.34, 8.88, 7.68 |
| all three | 6.59 | 5.72, 6.04, 5.72, 7.06, 8.42 |

Second run (2 random + 6 natural): base 7.89 s mean, all 5.78 s. Base at 1,024 rows was 8.79 s.
Numerics: the indexed arm's logits and 64-token decodes are identical on every prompt. For
all three switches, KL to base is mean 0.096; changing only the chunk size gives 0.026. See
docs/gotchas.md for that comparison. With all switches, 32K runs at 1,420 tok/s, the same rate as
8K: the fused indexer removed the cost that grew with length.

Serving with the same settings was 9–11 s at 8K. A serving-like gate (live .env, swaps on)
traced the difference to Triton compiles inside requests, not GPU work. Fixed in `prefill-v4`
(previous note in docs/gotchas.md).

**Live, `prefill-v4`** (bench/bench.py random workload, cold, fresh prompts, after one warm-up
request): 8K 6.07–8.8 s (930–1,348 tok/s; v3 and v4 runs, 8 requests), 32K 23.4–26.9 s
(1,220–1,404 tok/s). Morning baseline: 390–470 tok/s at both. TensorFold publishes 2,028 / 2,310.
Run-to-run variance in serving is still ±15%. Decode, prose/HTML/code: 26.9 / 51.6 / 39.9 tok/s
against 26.4 / 53.4 / 40.4 on fused-v1, with ms/step in the same range (73–98 ms). Prose TTFT
fell 1,181 → 881 ms.

Artifacts: `results/prefill-trace-20261008/` (`ab1/`, `ab2/`, `rows4096/`, `serving1/`,
`decode-engram-ab/`, `constexpr_check.py`, `image/build.sh`), `results/prefill-live-20261008/`,
`results/bench-switches-20261008/prefill-v4/`.

### 2026-10-08 — Prefill-only scaled FP4: qualified small screen, below the 2-second saving target

Implemented `DSV41_FP4_PREFILL_DOT_SCALED=1` as a separate, **default-off** arithmetic arm.
It selects the existing `tl.dot_scaled` kernels during prompt encoding and bounded decoder
replay, including short/tail chunks. The caller passes the actual prefill phase; row count
never selects the arithmetic. Ordinary verification and DSpark keep the existing CUDA decode
path. Original packed expert weights, BF16 linear-output boundaries, routing policy and
collective sequence are unchanged. The new setting appears in the boot-time rank agreement
and engine configuration. Prefill replicas retain their software-arithmetic restriction.

This was a request to optimize the remaining expert work, with an intended saving of about
**2 seconds per 8K prefill**. That is a time-saving target, not a target total latency or a
2-second expert component. The measured candidate **does not meet it**. A previous estimate
assumed a 2x expert speedup; the measured expert GPU envelopes improve only 1.46x. Do not
translate the whole existing expert cost into recoverable end-to-end time.

**Protocol.** Disposable TP2 containers based on the already deployed `prefill-v4`, image
`sha256:e3fe4870e3f95aad1932dbac04ddcadd8616a1b26bff39605efddf18ee963f71`; one loaded engine,
9,574 resident experts, 90.2 GB/rank, 65,536 context allocation, 2,048-row chunks, all existing
prefill/attention/HC settings retained. Frozen learned map, no prefix reuse, swaps, predictor
or demand persistence. Greedy decoding, thinking off, alternating baseline/candidate order
per prompt. Both arms warmed before measurement. This is an instrumented engine comparison,
not a live HTTP benchmark at the serving profile's 512K allocation.

`tools/bench_prefill_expert_tp.py` ran 36 graded prompts per arm:

| Objective checks | Baseline | Scaled prefill |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| JSON nesting, depths 4/6/8/10 and two leaves | 8/8 | 8/8 |
| Arithmetic with exact JSON answers | 4/4 | 4/4 |
| JSON extraction, keys/values/types | 4/4 | 4/4 |
| Python functions, parsing plus executable cases | 6/6 | 6/6 |
| Tool calls, strict checkpoint parser and exact arguments, no grammar constraint | 6/6 | 6/6 |
| Retrieval at 8K/16K/32K, facts near beginning/middle/end | 8/8 | 8/8 |

Tool calls were not executed. Python runs in a separate resource-limited subprocess with
restricted syntax and builtins. This is a bounded regression screen, not general quality
non-inferiority, sampled-decoding qualification, or validation beyond 32K. It broadens the
September single-nesting result without erasing that historical failure. All **88 requests**
(including warmups and timing-only requests) had identical prompt hashes and output tokens
between ranks; both retained map SHA256
`19a960c3c9ed5e86cd0130b6a8347ac3a4b9a4cb138d4fbe509856b7df4fa8b2`.

**Fresh random-text timings**, one output token, no prefix reuse. Mean times and total actual
prompt tokens divided by total prefill time; prompt lengths are approximately 8K/32K:

| Prompt / pairs | Baseline mean | Scaled mean | Time saved | Throughput before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8K / 4 | 6.164 s | 5.579 s | **0.585 s** | 1,327 → 1,466 tok/s (+10.5%) |
| 32K / 2 | 24.517 s | 22.652 s | 1.865 s | 1,337 → 1,447 tok/s (+8.2%) |

8K baseline times: 6.780 / 5.998 / 5.970 / 5.907 s; scaled: 5.351 / 5.521 / 6.049 /
5.395 s. Paired savings are 1.429 / 0.477 / **-0.079** / 0.512 s, mean 0.585 ± 0.312 s
standard error (n=4). One pair regressed; this small, variable sample does not establish a
universal 10.5% gain. The 8K saving is **29% of the 2-second target**, about 3.4x smaller.
The eight graded retrieval prompts also took less prefill time with the candidate in every
pair (14.513 → 13.085 s mean across the mixed lengths).

Rank-0 GPU event envelopes around expert up/down GEMMs: **2.400 → 1.642 s** at 8K and
8.864 → 6.432 s at 32K. These include stream idle/host launch delays and are not CUPTI
kernel-busy totals. Do not add their saving to the end-to-end saving; the latter already
includes it. Instrumentation is enabled equally in both arms.

**Follow-up tile screen.** Single GPU, actual layer-0 weights for 240 experts, TP-output
matrix shapes, synthetic uniform top-6 routes, rows 128/512/2048. All 66 measured schedule
cells matched the existing scaled arithmetic bit-for-bit. At 2,048 rows, up BM32/BN128/
4 warps/3 stages measured 11.955 ms versus baseline 13.802/14.002 ms; down BM32/BN128/
4 warps/4 stages measured 9.777 ms versus 10.556/10.860 ms. Smaller-row winners differ.
These component results do not demonstrate another 1.42 seconds saved in a full 8K prefill.
No tile change was promoted, and there is no full-engine result for those alternate schedules.

**Validation and disposition.** Real-weight independent BF16-reference checks at rows
1/4/17/128/513/2048: scaled relative L2 error <=9.80e-5, exact agreement with the old global
scaled arm, zero null contributions, and unchanged decode outputs when only the prefill flag
switches. 41 focused tests passed (prefill timing/dispatch, user-prompt streaming, prefill
graphs, prefix persistence and probe graders); `git diff --check` passed. The serving `.env`
was left unchanged and the original `prefill-v4` pair restored. The new arm stays opt-in in
both example configurations; no production speedup is claimed or deployed by this experiment.

Reproduce in an image containing the new engine/tools files, with serving stopped, using
`tools/run_two_node_gate.sh bench_prefill_expert_tp.py --suite short|long|timing --out ...`
(one suite per 900-second gate). Both ranks need identical image IDs. The driver freezes
adaptation and disables the shadow predictor; set `DSV41_PREFILL_ADAPT=0` and
`DSV41_PREFILL_MOE_TIMING=1` identically on both ranks for the table above. The retained
private all-in-one runner uses an 1,800-second bound.

Artifacts: `results/prefill-expert-20261008/`, including `paired-v3/rank{0,1}.json`,
`kernel.json`, `analysis.json`, `sweep_scaled.py`, `sweep.json`, image sources and gate logs.
The first two gates stopped before inference: the serving shadow predictor requires swaps,
then an outer `inference_mode()` made asynchronously populated arenas unwritable. Both were
harness setup errors, corrected before the measured run; their logs are retained.

### 2026-10-08 — Prefill-scaled FP4 reviewed, tiles promoted, deployed (`prefill-v5`)

Review of the default-off arm above. The code is as described: the phase is passed explicitly,
the setting is in the guard, decode graphs and replicas are untouched. It was missing a
comparison against the engine's own numerical noise and an engine run of the tile winners.

Paired gate on `prefill-v4` + working tree, frozen map, 2,048 rows, arms rotated per prompt, 3
random 8K + 6 natural prompts (repo docs/code, ~8K, 64-token continuations). Reference arm:
`all` (the serving prefill switches).

| Arm | Mean prefill s | Paired vs `all` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| all | 5.755 | — |
| + scaled experts | 5.307 | -0.448 ± 0.219 s |
| + scaled + 32-row tiles | **4.963** | **-0.792 ± 0.143 s** |
| all at 1,024 rows (noise reference) | 6.541 | +0.786 ± 0.130 s |

Logits against `all`: scaled mean KL 0.119 (max 0.37), top-1 9/9; the 1,024-row reference
0.042 (max 0.22), 9/9. The tiles reproduced the scaled arm's continuations on 9/9 prompts.
Decode, `tools/bench_accept_ab_tp.py` `fused_pf_old` vs `fused_pf_new` (all prefill kernels off
vs on, decode settings identical, 22 prompts): ms/step +0.27 ± 0.49, acceptance -0.030 ±
0.027, tok/s -0.59 ± 0.39. No significant decode effect.

**Live on `prefill-v5`** (cold random prompts after one warm-up): 8K 5.56–5.74 s
(**1,423–1,471 tok/s**, 5 requests), 32K 22.5–23.0 s (**1,426–1,454 tok/s**). `prefill-v4`:
8K median 6.5 s (1,255), 32K ~1,300. Run-to-run spread fell from ±1 s to ±0.1 s. Decode
prose/HTML/code: 26.0 / 51.5 / 38.7 tok/s, ms/step in the same 73–98 ms range.
TensorFold publishes 2,028 / 2,310; we are now at 0.70x / 0.62x.

Artifacts: `results/prefill-trace-20261008/scaled-ab/`, `decode-prefill-ab/`,
`results/prefill-live-20261008/v5-*.json`, `results/bench-switches-20261008/prefill-v5/`.

## 2026-10-08 — EXL3 decode tuning: merged collectives, draft-ahead, resident budget; dense EXL3 rejected

Starting point (live, `EXPERT_FORMAT=exl3`, FP4's residency settings): prose / HTML / code
27.6 / 59.8 / 42.9 tok/s, 68 ms per depth-3 step, prefill 8K 8.09 s and 32K 32.8 s (FP4 on
`prefill-v5`: 5.58 / 22.8 s). A decode step's GPU is busy 96% of the time
(`tools/bench_decode_kernels_tp.py`, python workload): routed experts 35 ms, FP8 dense 25 ms,
collectives 8 ms, then ~2,700 small kernels; the EXL3 kernel itself reaches 185–213 GB/s
L2-cold against a ~205–240 GB/s plain read (`tools/bench_exl3_moe_decode.py`), so the routed
experts are bytes, not kernel quality.

| Change | Measured | Exact? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DSV41_EXL3_MERGED` (default on): the shared-expert and routed EXL3 intermediates in one RoCE gather, outputs summed before one gather, next-layer L2 prefetch under it (FP4's `_moe_merged`); decode grouping kernel parallel (48 → 11 µs a layer) | html 73.97 → 71.92, python 75.77 → 73.96, explain 71.02 → 68.82 ms/step; NCCL 3.1 → 0.7 ms/step | token hashes identical (3/3) |
| `DSV41_RESIDENT_EXPERTS` 9,574 → 13,500 (the EXL3 arena's 13,514 LRU slots; was FP4's count, leaving ~26 GB of slots empty) | distinct experts a layer 21.1 → 21.5 (python), 17.2 → 16.0 (explain); tok/s within noise | routing changes (87% of experts routable instead of 62%) |
| `DSV41_EARLY_VERIFY` + `DSV41_EARLY_DRAFT` (default on): hash ids leave on a side stream and layer 0 is queued before the host waits; the next greedy draft is queued from the device-side accept count before the host reads it | paired 24 prompts, depth 3: **-2.03 ± 0.49 ms/step, +1.24 ± 0.29 tok/s (+2.9%)** | 24/24 outputs identical |
| Urgent-adaptation counters staged with the verify readback | removes a per-step `.tolist()` that waited for the queued draft (live only: the gate's map is frozen) | same values |

Live after all of them (single-boot, 3 requests a workload, depth policy free): prose 29.1–31.3,
HTML 61.3–63.0, code 45.1–45.6 tok/s. Prose moves ±5% between boots with acceptance
(1.90–2.06 tokens a step) as the learned residency drifts; the paired gate numbers above are the
ones to trust. Prose step time is 63–65 ms.

**Rejected: EXL3 dense attention + shared expert (`DSV41_EXL3_DENSE=1`, default off).** The
checkpoint stores wq_a/wkv/wq_b/wo_a/wo_b at 5 bits (one layer at 6) and the shared experts at
4–5; `tools/pack_exl3_dense.py` slices a rank's 2.1 GB the way `engine/tensor_parallel.py`
shards FP8, and the routed experts' grouped kernel runs them as GEMVs (split-K per shape).
Microbenchmark, T = 4, L2-cold: 273 vs 394 µs a layer against the FP8 kernels' engine times
(-4.9 ms a step if it all landed). Unit test: 1.6–1.7e-3 relative to the fp64 reference,
row-invariant. The abliteration overlay is rank-1 against the base wo_b (σ = 6.8–9.5, then
≤ 0.62 and flat, FP8 rounding), so the pack carries that term and the projection adds it.
In the engine (paired, 24 prompts, both weight sets resident and switched at runtime):

| | FP8 dense | EXL3 dense | paired |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ms/step | 65.29 | 63.99 | -1.30 ± 0.53 |
| accepted tokens/step | 2.89 | 2.82 | **-0.071 ± 0.024** |
| tok/s | 44.16 | 43.94 | -0.22 ± 0.53 |

Teacher-forced on the FP8 arm's greedy continuations (12 prompts, 1,152 positions, each arm's
own KV, `tools/bench_exl3_dense_quality_tp.py`): top-1 agreement **0.976**, KL mean 0.0094
nats, p99 0.17, max 0.66; the FP8 arm reproduced its own reference 1.000. Only a third of the
microbenchmark's saving survived (three launches a matrix, wq_a/wkv no longer one GEMV), and the
FP8-trained drafter agrees less with the changed target. No throughput gain for a 2.4% top-1
change: off.

Prefill is unchanged by this work (EXL3 prefill 866–1,012 tok/s at 8K vs FP4's 1,423–1,471):
the decode-shaped grouped kernel decodes each weight tile once per 16 rows; a prefill tile
kernel is still owed (`tools/bench_exl3_prefill.py` times its stages per rank).

Artifacts: `results/exl3-tune-20261008/` (live runs `exl3-live-v1..v5`, `live-v1-{8k,32k}.json`,

### 2026-10-08 — EXL3 prefill at FP4 parity: a prefill tile kernel and static routes

EXL3 prefill ran the decode kernel (`exl3::grouped_kernel`): one program per 16 rows of a
routing block, K split over four warps and reduced in shared memory, so every 16 rows re-decoded
-- and re-read -- the expert's trellis. `exl3m_prefill` (`tools/exl3_moe_cuda.cu`) gives a warp
NT n-tiles over the whole K and applies each decoded tile to all MT 16-row m-tiles of its block;
warps split N, nothing is reduced. One layer, rank shapes, T = 2,048, 384 real experts, Zipf
routing (`tools/bench_exl3_prefill.py`):

| kernel | gate/up ms | down ms | layer ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| grouped (decode kernel), BM 64 | 33.0 | 14.8 | 52.8 |
| tile, BM 64 (4 m-tiles), best of 5 shapes | 18.8 | 9.0 | 32.6 |
| **tile, BM 32, 4 n-tiles x 2 warps** (default) | 13.7 | 6.9 | **25.5** |
| tile, BM 16 | 14.4 | 6.5 | 25.8 |

Every BM 32/16 shape landed at 25.5–27.5 ms: occupancy (BM 64 holds 128 accumulators a thread)
mattered more than decodes per row. Output vs the grouped kernel 7.6e-5 relative (K summed in one
chain instead of four warp partials); BM 16 and BM 32 give identical bits.

The EXL3 branch of `Model.moe` also grouped each layer with `torch.unique` and a host sync; it now
takes the engine's static per-layer compact routes as FP4 does (`prefill_routes`, -1 for the TP
null entry): bit-identical, -0.22 s per 8K prompt.

Gate, frozen map, 2,048-row chunks, the 9 prompts of `scaled-ab` above (3 random 8K + 6 natural):

| arm | mean prefill s |
| --- | ---: |
| EXL3 grouped kernel (separate run, other natural texts) | 6.10 |
| EXL3 tile, unique() routing | 5.321 |
| **EXL3 tile, static routes** | **5.103** |
| FP4 `all_sct` (serving prefill), same boot harness | 5.061 |

Logits tile vs grouped: KL mean 0.074, top-1 8/9 (FP4's chunk-size noise 0.042, the accepted
scaled change 0.119). Live (`.env`, adaptation on, 13,500 residents): **8K 5.32–5.35 s
(1,533 tok/s), 32K 21.4 s (1,528 tok/s)**, against EXL3's 8.09 s / 32.8 s before and FP4's
5.56–5.74 s / 22.5–23.0 s on `prefill-v5`. Decode unchanged: prose / HTML / code 30.5 / 64.3 /
45.3 tok/s, prose 62.4–62.7 ms a step.

### 2026-10-08 — EXL3 CUDA quality against saved Mia Q3 runs

Served `exl3-cuda`, 92.3 GB arena, 13,813 resident budget, **90.1% residency**;
EXL3 dense off, dynamic expert adaptation on. Replayed the 244 item IDs from
`llm_benchmark/mia-q3.json` and `mia-q3-pass2.json` (October 5, both identical
per-item scores), using `quality_quant3.py`, temperature 0, thinking disabled
with both template keys, and original per-family token caps. Source, prompts,
responses, image identity and per-request health snapshots are saved.

| Family | Current EXL3 CUDA | Saved Mia |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| MMLU | 179/200 | 179/200 |
| Executable code | 9/10 | 9/10 |
| Arithmetic | 12/12 | 12/12 |
| Retrieval, ~2K/8K/32K | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| Strict JSON | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| Nested JSON | 4/4 | 4/4 |
| Exact word-count constraints | **7/12** | **10/12** |

**305.8 s**, all 244 requests completed normally, none truncated. MMLU has
2 current-only correct and 2 Mia-only correct items; code's shared failure is
`parse_kv`. Three extra word-count misses were manually verified. A separate
12-item constraint repeat scored **8/12**, with different misses. Mean constraint
partial credit: 79.73% first pass / 79.58% repeat vs Mia's 88.33% on both runs.
The first run remains the primary comparison; the repeat is diagnostic.

Six category scores match; exact word-count compliance is lower in these samples.
This is not isolated quantization or residency loss: these are different served
configurations and the current expert map adapts. Historical Mia files omit full
request/configuration provenance; item IDs and MMLU answer keys match, but exact
historical source/template parity is not established. The 12-item constraint
sample is small (paired exact p=0.25 first pass), not a broad quality verdict.

Artifacts: `results/exl3-mia-quality-cuda-20261008/REPORT.md`, `current.json`,
`answers.jsonl`, `paired-differences.json`, `constraint-repeat.json`, and the
copied baselines/runner. The stopped `exl3-ref` attempt in
`results/exl3-mia-quality-20261008/` is excluded.

### 2026-10-08 — FP4 and EXL3 profiles side by side (README numbers)

Same image (`deepseek-v41-flash-spark:20261008`), same `.env` except `EXPERT_FORMAT` and the
predictor database, `ARENA_GB=92.3`, resident count automatic (`auto_budget`: every LRU slot but
16). Decode: `results/readme-20261008/run.py` (3 workloads, warmup + 2 x 512 tokens, temperature
0); prefill: `bench/bench.py --workload random`, 8K x5 and 32K x2, cold.

| | FP4 | EXL3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Residents | 9,793 (63.9%) | 13,813 (90.1%) |
| Essay / HTML / Python decode, tok/s | 25.6 / 49.3 / 39.4 | 31.0 / 64.4 / 46.7 |
| 8K prefill, median (runs) | 6.15 s (6.15, 6.85, 5.78, 5.49, 18.35) | 5.67 s (8.93, 7.55, 5.67, 5.45, 5.33) |
| 32K prefill | 22.73 s (23.3, 22.16) | 23.51 s (23.62, 23.39) |

FP4 ran directly after the profile switch: its residency had to move from the EXL3-shaped
demand history, two decode requests waited 16 and 24 s behind idle-time re-planning (their
prefill took under 1 s) and one 8K run 18.4 s. Steady-state prefill is at parity between the
formats within this noise. A 95.3 GB arena (93% EXL3 residents) left node 1 7.2 GB and the
prefill budget halved the chunk to 1,024 rows: 8K 7.36 s. The first request after a boot pays a
one-time warm-up (3,755 tokens: 10.8 s cold vs ~2.3 s for the next cold prompts).
Artifacts: `results/readme-20261008/` (`exl3-923*`, `fp4-923*`, `exl3-953-contaminated*`: that
run overlapped an outside request and is not used).

### 2026-10-08 — All routed experts resident: exact-size EXL3 slots

Every EXL3 arena slot was sized for a 3-bit expert (6.67 MB a node); the 1,920 2-bit experts of
layers 18-22 (4.46 MB) wasted 4.25 GB a node, so holding all 15,360 needed 102.6 GB.
`DSV41_EXL3_EXACT_SLOTS=1` gives `Exl3Arena` a narrow pool for them (the kernels already address
slots through a per-slot pointer table); the store assigns 2-bit experts to narrow slots, and the
mode is refused unless every expert is resident, since a narrow slot cannot take a swapped-in 3-bit
expert. `tools/test_exl3_moe_cuda.py` runs decode and prefill against the reference on both layouts
and checks that a narrow slot refuses a 3-bit expert.

`.env.example.exl3.allweight` (98.4 GB arena, 200K context, 256 MiB worker Engram cache), booted
on the pair: 1,920 2-bit + 13,464 3-bit slots = 98.37 GB, **15,360 of 15,360 resident**, warm start
98.2 GB read in 26 s; MemAvailable after boot 8.0 / 8.6 GB (node 0 / 1).

| | EXL3 92.3 GB (13,813, 90%) | all weights (15,360) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Essay / HTML / Python decode, tok/s | 31.0 / 64.4 / 46.7 | 30.2 / 64.9 / 43.7 |
| 8K prefill (median of 5) | 5.67 s | 7.26 s |
| 32K prefill | 23.5 s | 35.4 s (40.2, 30.6) |
| prefill chunk (budget) | 2,048 rows | 512 rows |

Stress: two 32K prompts with 1,024-token answers completed (decode 51.9 tok/s on the random-word
continuation); MemAvailable never fell below 5.6 / 4.6 GB, against the 2.5 GB watchdog. The prefill
slowdown is the budget's arithmetic (2 MiB a row estimated plus a 4 GiB floor), not a measured
shortage: with 512-row chunks 4.6 GB stayed free. Artifacts: `results/readme-20261008/` (`exl3-allweight*`,
`allweight-stress*`, `allweight-mem.txt`, `run_allweight.sh`).
